# Version 3.6.0

_2022-09-08_

This version brings initial support for `@defer` as well as data builders.

## üíôÔ∏è External contributors

Many thanks to @engdorm, @Goooler, @pt2121 and @StylianosGakis for their contributions!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `@defer` support

`@defer` support is experimental in the Kotlin Client and currently a [Stage 2 GraphQL specification draft](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#stage-2-draft) to allow incremental delivery of response payloads. 

`@defer` allows you to specify a fragment as deferrable, meaning it can be omitted in the initial response and delivered as a subsequent payload. This improves latency for all fields that are not in that fragment. You can read more about `@defer` in the [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md) and contribute/ask question in the [`@defer` working group](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg).

Apollo Kotlin supports `@defer` by default and will deliver the successive payloads as `Flow` items. Given the below query:

```graphql
query GetComputer {
  computer {
    __typename
    id
    ...ComputerFields @defer
  }
}

fragment ComputerFields on Computer {
  cpu
  year
  screen {
    resolution
  }
}
```

And the following server payloads:

**payload 1**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "computer": {
      "__typename": "Computer",
      "id": "Computer1"
    }
  },
  "hasNext": true
}
```

**payload 2**:
```json
{
  "incremental": [
    {
      "data": {
        "cpu": "386",
        "year": 1993,
        "screen": {
          "resolution": "640x480"
        }
      },
      "path": [
        "computer",
      ]
    }
  ],
  "hasNext": true
}
```

You can listen to payloads by using `toFlow()`:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(query).toFlow().collectIndexed { index, response ->
  // This will be called twice

  if (index == 0) {
    // First time without the fragment
    assertNull(response.data?.computer?.computerFields)
  } else if (index == 1) {
    // Second time with the fragment
    assertNotNull(response.data?.computer?.computerFields)
  }
}
```

You can read more about it in [the documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/fetching/defer).

As always, feedback is very welcome. Let us know what you think of the feature by
either [opening an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/issues)
, [joining the community](http://community.apollographql.com/new-topic?category=Help&tags=mobile,client)

invite [here](https://slack.kotl.in/)).

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Data Builders (#4321)

Apollo Kotlin 3.0 introduced [test builders](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/testing/test-builders/). While they are working, they have several limitations. The main one was that being [response based](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/response-based-codegen#the-responsebased-codegen), they could generate a lot of code. Also, they required passing custom scalars using their Json encoding, which is cumbersome. 

The [data builders](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/testing/data-builders/) are a simpler version of the test builders that generate builders based on schema types. This means most of the generated code is shared between all your implementations except for a top level `Data {}` function in each of your operation:

```kotlin
// Replace
val data = GetHeroQuery.Data {
  hero = humanHero {
    name = "Luke"
  }
} 

// With
val data = GetHeroQuery.Data {
  hero = buildHuman {
    name = "Luke"
  }
} 
```

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Kotlin 1.7 (#4314)

Starting with this release, Apollo Kotlin is built with Kotlin 1.7.10. This doesn't impact Android and JVM projects (the minimum supported version of Kotlin continues to be 1.5) but if you are on a project using Native, you will need to update the Kotlin version to 1.7.0+.

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

* fix registering Java scalars. Many thanks @parker for catching this. (#4375)
* Data builders (#4359, #4338, #4331, #4330, #4328, #4323, #4321)
* Add a flag to disable fieldsCanMerge validation on disjoint types (#4342)
* Re-introduce @defer and use new payload format (#4351)
* Multiplatform: add enableCompatibilityMetadataVariant flag (#4329)
* Remove an unnecessary `file.source().buffer()` (#4326)
* Always use String for defaultValue in introspection Json (#4315)
* Update Kotlin dependency to 1.7.10 (#4314)
* Remove schema and AST from the IR (#4303)

# Version 3.5.0 

_2022-08-01_

With this release, Apollo Kotlin now uses Kotlin Native's new memory model. It also contains a number of other improvements and bug fixes. 

## üíôÔ∏è External contributors

Many thanks to `@glureau` for carefully adding new watch targets ‚åöüíô.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Kotlin Native: new memory manager (#4287)

Apollo Kotlin is now requiring applications to use the [new memory manager, a.k.a. new memory model](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/08/try-the-new-kotlin-native-memory-manager-development-preview/). Thanks to this change, the restriction that operations had to be executed from the main thread on Apple targets is now removed. You can also use [kotlinx.coroutines.test.runTest](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-test/kotlinx.coroutines.test/run-test.html). Last but not least, benchmarks seem to [indicate](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/4287/files?w=1#diff-aead75359419ef1647be74310bd7093e4cc2d9393917d17029d5fcc5e11ce1ef) that performance is better under the new memory manager!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `@targetName` directive (#4243)

This directive was introduced in v3.3.1 to allow overriding the name of enum values in the generated code. It has now been extended to allow configuring the generated name of Interfaces, Enums, Unions, Scalars and Input objects. This can be used to make the generated code nicer to use, or to avoid name clashes with Kotlin types (e.g. `Long`) in Kotlin Native.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Automatic resolution of Apollo artifacts versions from the plugin version (#4279)

From now on, you no longer need to specify explicitly the versions of Apollo dependencies: if omitted, the same version as the Apollo Gradle plugin will be used. This should facilitate upgrades and avoid potential mistakes:

```kotlin
plugins {
  plugins {
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm").version("1.7.10")
    id("com.apollographql.apollo3").version("3.5.0")
  }

  dependencies {
    // Replace this
    // implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime:3.5.0")
    
    // with
    implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime")
  }
}

```

## üöß [deprecated] `runTest` (#4292)

With the new memory model, Apollo's specific `runTest` method from `apollo-testing-support` is no longer useful and has been deprecated. If you were using it, you should now be able to use [Kotlin's `runTest`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/kotlinx-coroutines-test/README.md) instead, or simply `runBlocking`.


## üöß [breaking] Automatic detection of `type` enum values.

If you have an enum with a `type` value, this value used to name clash with the generated `type` property. This version now detects this case automatically and escapes `type` to `type_`. If you had previously used `@targetName` to workaround this issue, you can now remove it to avoid it being escaped twice:

```graphql 
# Remove this
extend enum SomeEnum {
  type @targetName(name: "type_")
}
```

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

- Support watchosArm32 (#4260)
- Support @targetName on Interfaces, Enums, Unions, Scalars and Input objects (#4243)
- üêò  support lazy APIs for newer AGP versions (#4264)
- Pagination: add connectionFields argument to @typePolicy (#4265)
- üêò Get the dependencies version from the plugin automagically (#4279)
- Automatically escape `type` in enum values (#4295)
- Fix inferred variables in both nullable and non-nullable locations (#4306)
- Native: assume New Memory Manager (#4287)
- Use internal runTest in all tests (#4292)

# Version 3.4.0

_2022-07-11_

This release contains a few important bug fixes (#4214, #4224, #4247, #4256), makes it possible to compile with Gradle
7.4 and `apollo-gradle-plugin` (#4218).

It also introduces `-incubating` cache artifacts.

## üíôÔ∏è External contributors

Many thanks to @ArjanSM, @zebehringer, @mm-kk-experiments, @mune0903, @stengvac, @elenigen, @shamsidinb,
@StylianosGakis for the awesome contributions üòÉ!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `-incubating` cache artifacts.

This version introduces the below artifacts:

- `apollo-normalized-cache-incubating`
- `apollo-normalized-cache-api-incubating`
- `apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite-incubating`

These artifacts introduce new APIs to work with cache expiration and pagination (as well
as [other cache improvements](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/2331) in the future).

These artifacts have no backward compatibility guarantees and most likely have worse performance than the non-incubating
artifacts. Documentation will be added once the API stabilize. In the short term, the best place to look for examples
are the integration tests:

- [Expiration tests](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/blob/363c73d89f1f0bbe773e98fbfac873c8b93b666d/tests/sqlite/src/commonTest/kotlin/ExpirationTest.kt)
- [Pagination tests](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/tree/d5b4fc3f12087e8a3585cd63531ccc590dee3098/tests/pagination/src/commonTest/kotlin)

_Note_: The experimental `withDates: Boolean` argument was introduced in 3.3.1 in the regular artifacts and is removed
as part of this release. Use the `-incubating` artifacts to use it.

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

- add TrimmableNormalizedCacheFactory (#4239)
- üöß remove withDates (#4257)
- üóÑÔ∏è Chunk parameters in large responses (#4256)
- Fix for improper handling of JsonNumber in BufferedSinkJsonWriter (#4247)
- Incubating modules for the next gen cache (#4241)
- Pagination: fixes in FieldRecordMerger and MemoryCache (#4237)
- make it possible to reuse a File Upload (#4228)
- Persist Record arguments/metadata with the SQL Json backend (#4211)
- requestedDispatcher -> dispatcher (#4220)
- Fix test errors were emitted outside the Flow (#4224)
- Make it possible to compile with Kotlin 1.5 and apollo-gradle-plugin (#4218)
- üèñÔ∏è Relax MapJsonReader endObject, fixes reading inline + named fragments with compat models (#4214)
- Introduce RecordMerger (#4197)
- Add @typePolicy(embeddedFields: String! = "") (#4196)

# Version 3.3.2

_2022-06-17_

This is a hot fix release that fixes a crash that could happen in the codegen when using `responseBased` codegen in a
multimodule setup. It also includes a fix for incorrect generated code when using certain reserved names in enum values.

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

- Update to KotlinPoet `1.12.0`, fixes generating enum values whose name clashes with other symbols (#4034)
- Update to Ktor 2 (#4190)
- Fix NPE in checkCapitalizedFields (#4201)

# Version 3.3.1

_2022-06-13_

This release introduces `@typePolicy` on interface/enums, improvements on subscription error handling, and on Test
Builders. It also contains a number of other improvements and bug fixes!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `@typePolicy` on interfaces and unions (#4131)

[The `@typePolicy` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/caching/declarative-ids#typepolicy) can now be
declared on interfaces and unions. Thank you @bubba for the contribution!

## üîå WebSockets / Subscriptions error handling (#4147)

An issue where `websocketReopenWhen` was not called in some cases was fixed. Also, this release
introduces `SubscriptionOperationException`. A `SubscriptionOperationException` will be thrown instead of the more
generic `ApolloNetworkError` if a subscription fails due to a specific operation error.

## üìê Test Builders improvements and fixes

* A DslMarker was added to improve usage with nested builders (#4089)
* When calling a builder, but not assigning it to a field, an error is now thrown, preventing mistakes (#4122)
* The error message displayed when `__typename` is missing was made clearer (#4146)
* Fix: use `rawValue` instead of `name` for enums (#4121)

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] ApolloClient implements Closable (#4142)

`ApolloClient` now implements `okio.Closable` so you can
use [`use`](https://square.github.io/okio/3.x/okio/okio/okio/use.html) with it. Thanks @yogurtearl for this
contribution!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] experimental `@targetName` directive on enum values (#4144)

If an enum value name is clashing with a reserved name (e.g. `type`) you can now use this directive to instruct the
codeGen to use the specified name for the value instead. This directive is experimental for now.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] experimental support for renaming directives (#4174)

As we add more client directives, the risk of nameclash with existing schema directives increases. If this happens, you
can now import Apollo client directives using `@link`:

```graphql
# extra.graphqls
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/kotlin_labs/v0.1") 
```

This adds a `@kotlin_labs__` prefix to all Apollo client directives:

```graphql
{
  hero {
    name @kotlin_labs__nonnull
  }
}
```

## ü§ñ `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory` initialization on Android (#4104)

It is no longer necessary to pass a `Context` when initializing the `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory` on Android. A `Context`
is automatically provided, via [App Startup](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/app-startup).

```kotlin
// Before
val sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory(context, "apollo.db")

// After
val sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory("apollo.db")
```

## üìù [new] Public API tracking

This release starts tracking the public API of all modules, including MockServer. Even if the API remains experimental,
we'll try to keep the number of breaking changes low in the future.

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

- üêò publish `apollo-gradle-plugin-external` (#4078)
- publish the R8 mapping file along the relocated jar (#4085)

- Uploads should be read only once even when logging (#4125)
- Keep the 'interfaces' field on the JSON introspection (#4129)
- Allow @typePolicy directive on interfaces and unions (#4131)
- typePolicy on interface: exclude empty keyfields (#4140)
- Sort the type names in the list so the code gen is deterministic. (#4138)

# Version 3.3.0

_2022-05-04_

This is the first release with [HMPP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-hierarchy.html) support. If you're using
multiplatform, updating to Kotlin 1.6.21 is strongly encouraged.

This release also brings WebSocket related improvements and other fixes!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Hierarchical MultiPlatform Project (HMPP) (#4033)

When using Apollo Kotlin on a multiplatform project, this release is compatible with
the [hierarchical project structure](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-hierarchy.html), which makes it easier to
share common code among several targets. Using HMPP in your project also fixes some issues when compiling Kotlin
metadata. See https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/4019
and https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-51970/ for more details.

**‚úã Note**: If you're using multiplatform, we strongly encourage updating to Kotlin 1.6.21. If that is not an option,
you might have issues resolving dependencies. More infos
in [this issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/4095#issuecomment-1123571706).

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `WebSocketNetworkTransport.closeConnection` (#4049)

This new method can be used in conjunction
with [`reopenWhen`](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-kotlin/kdoc/apollo-runtime/com.apollographql.apollo3/-apollo-client/-builder/web-socket-reopen-when.html)
to force a reconnection to the server. This could be useful for instance when needing to pass new auth tokens in the
headers. If you were using `subscriptionManager.reconnect()` in 2.x, `closeConnection` is a simple way to achieve the
same behaviour.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `GraphQLWsProtocol.connectionPayload` is now a lambda (#4043)

With `GraphQLWsProtocol`, if you need to pass parameters to the connection payload, previously you would pass them as a
static map to the builder. With this change you can now pass a lambda providing them as needed. This facilitates passing
fresh auth tokens when connecting.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Add insecure option to download schema (#4021)

You can now use the `--insecure` flag when downloading a schema
with [`downloadApolloSchema`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/plugin-configuration/#downloading-a-schema)
, to bypass the certificate check, which can be useful if a server is configured with a self-signed certificate for
instance.

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

- Add WebSocketNetworkTransport.closeConnection (#4049)
- Made connectionPayload as suspend function in GraphQLWsProtocol (#4043)
- ‚ö° Ignore unknown websocket messages (#4066)
- Kotlin 1.6.21 & HMPP (#4033)
- Provide a Content-Length when using Upload (#4056)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è add HttpRequest.newBuilder(url, method) (#4038)
- Escape enum constants (#4035)
- Fix the Moshi adapter used for OperationOutput. Moshi cannot get the type parameters from the typealias
  automagically (#4022)
- Add insecure option to download schema (#4021)
- Try to reduce allocations in MapJsonReader (#3935)
- üîí Deprecate BearerTokenInterceptor and provide tests and docs instead (#4068)

## ‚ù§Ô∏è External contributors

Many thanks to @CureleaAndrei and @kdk96 for contributing to this release! üôè

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deprecations

- `BearerTokenInterceptor` was provided as an example but is too simple for most use cases, and has therefore been
  deprecated
  in this release. [This page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/authentication) provides more details
  about authentication.
- The previous ways of passing parameters to the connection payload with `GraphQLWsProtocol` has been deprecated (see
  above).

# Version 3.2.2

_2022-04-11_

A maintenance release to fix the `addJvmOverloads` option added in 3.2.0 as well as other fixes. If you're using APQs,
the mutations are now always send using `POST`.
See [#4006](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/4006#issuecomment-1092628783) for details and a way to
override the behaviour if you really need to.

Many thanks to @benedict-lim, @olivierg13, @konomae and @sproctor for their contributions üíô

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

* Use a constant for JvmOverloads to avoid a crash due to relocation (#4008)
* Always use POST for Mutations in APQs (Auto Persisted Queries) (#4011)
* Add configurable headers to WebSocketNetworkTransport (#3995)
* Handle SqlNormalizedCache merge APIs Exceptions with ApolloExceptionHandler (#4002)
* Add adapter for java.time.OffsetDateTime (#4007)
* ‚è∞ Add tests for date adapters (#3999)
* Fix wrong LocalDate and LocalDateTime formats in JavaTimeAdapters (#3997)

# Version 3.2.1

_2022-04-05_

This release introduces a few improvements and bug fixes.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `ApolloCall<D>.emitCacheMisses(Boolean)` (#3980)

When observing the cache with `watch`, the behavior was to not emit cache misses at all, which may not desirable in
certain cases. With this new option, you can now choose to emit them: in that case responses will be emitted with a
null `data`.

This can be used like so:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(query)
    .fetchPolicy(FetchPolicy.CacheOnly)
    .emitCacheMisses(true)
    .watch()
    .collect { response ->
      // response.data will be null in case of cache misses
    }
```

This is also closer to the behavior that was in place in v2. Many thanks to @mateuszkwiecinski for the insights and
raising the issue!

## ‚öôÔ∏è [breaking] Allow configuration of frame types used in `SubscriptionWsProtocol` and default to Text (#3992)

When using subscriptions over WebSockets with `SubscriptionWsProtocol` (the default), the frames were sent in the binary
format. It was reported that this was not compatible with certain servers ([DGS](https://netflix.github.io/dgs)
, [graphql-java-kickstart](https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-spring-boot)) that are expecting text
frames. This is now fixed and the default is to send text frames.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This may be a breaking change if your server expects binary frames only!

If that is the case, you can use the new `frameType` option to configure the frame type to be sent:

```kotlin
client = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .webSocketServerUrl("wss://...")
    .wsProtocol(GraphQLWsProtocol.Factory(frameType = WsFrameType.Binary))
    .build()
```

Many thanks to @Krillsson and @aviewfromspace1 for the insights and raising the issue!

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

* Allow configuration of frame types used in SubscriptionWsProtocol and default to Text (#3992)
* add `ApolloRequest.newBuilder(operation: Operation<E>)`  (#3988)
* Add exception handlers to ApolloCacheInterceptor and SqlNormalizedCache (#3989)
* üì† Fix some @DeprecatedSince annotations (#3983)
* üëì add ApolloCall<D>.emitCacheMisses(Boolean) (#3980)
* ‚öôÔ∏è Fix fragments on the root query type in operationBased codegen (#3973)

# Version 3.2.0

_2022-03-29_

üíô Thanks to @undermark5, @demoritas, @rkoron007, @akshay253101, @StylianosGakis, @Goooler, @jeffreydecker, @theBradfo,
@anderssandven and @olivierg13 for contributing to this release.

This version adds JS WebSocket support, more options to deal with `__typename` amongst other features and bugfixes.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] JS WebSocket support (#3913)

Version 3.2.0 now has WebSocket support for Javascript targets courtesy of @undermark5! This is a huge milestone and
means the JS target is now even closer to its JVM and iOS counterparts.

|  | `jvm` | Apple | `js` | `linuxX64`
| --- | :---: |:-----:|:----:| :---: |
| `apollo-api` (models)|‚úÖ|   ‚úÖ   |  ‚úÖ   |‚úÖ|
| `apollo-runtime` (network, query batching, apq, ...) |‚úÖ|   ‚úÖ   |  ‚úÖ   |üö´|

| `apollo-http-cache` |‚úÖ|  üö´   |  üö´  |üö´|

The implementation is based on the [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library on Node and
the [`WebSocket` API](https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org//) on the browser and inspired by [Ktor](https://ktor.io/).

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Fine grained `__typename` control (#3939)

This version generates non-nullable fragments when it knows the fragment is always present:

```graphql
{
  cat {
    # Because Animal is a supertype of Cat this condition will always be true
    ... on Animal {
      species
    }
  }
}
```

In addition, it introduces a `addTypename` Gradle option to have better control over when to add the `__typename` field:

```kotlin
/**
 * When to add __typename. One of "always", "ifFragments", "ifAbstract" or "ifPolymorphic"
 *
 * - "always": Add '__typename' for every compound field
 *
 * - "ifFragments": Add '__typename' for every selection set that contains fragments (inline or named)
 * This is adding a lot more '__typename' than the other solutions and will be certainly removed in
 * a future version. If you require '__typename' explicitly, you can add it to your queries.
 * This causes cache misses when introducing fragments where no fragment was present before and will be certainly removed in
 * a future version.
 *
 * - "ifAbstract": Add '__typename' for abstract fields, i.e. fields that are of union or interface type
 * Note: It also adds '__typename' on fragment definitions that satisfy the same property because fragments
 * could be read from the cache and we don't have a containing field in that case.
 *
 * - "ifPolymorphic": Add '__typename' for polymorphic fields, i.e. fields that contains a subfragment
 * (inline or named) whose type condition isn't a super type of the field type.
 * If a field is monomorphic, no '__typename' will be added.
 * This adds the bare minimum amount of __typename but the logic is substantially more complex and
 * it could cause cache misses when using fragments on monomorphic fields because __typename can be
 * required in some cases.
 *
 * Note: It also adds '__typename' on fragment definitions that satisfy the same property because fragments
 * could be read from the cache and we don't have a containing field in that case.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Maven publishing for multi-module apollo metadata (#3904)

The Apollo Gradle plugin now creates a new "apollo" publication if `maven-publish` is found. This means you can now
publish the Apollo metadata to a maven repository:

```bash
# In your producer project
./gradlew publishApolloPublicationTo[SomeRepository]
``` 

Assuming your producer project is using `com.example:project:version` for maven coordinates, the Apollo metadata will be
published at `com.example:project-apollo:version`:

```kotlin
// In your consumer project
dependencies {
  implementation("com.example:project:version")
  apolloMetadata("com.example:project-apollo:version")
}
```

**Note**: There are absolutely no forward/backward compatibility guarantees for Apollo metadata yet. The Apollo version
used in the consumer **must** be the same as the one used in the producer.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `addJvmOverloads` Gradle option (#3907)

For better Java interop, you can now opt-in `addJvmOverloads`. `addJvmOverloads` will add the `@JvmOverloads` to your
Kotlin operations:

```kotlin
@JvmOverloads
class GetHeroQuery(val id: String, val episode: Optional<Episode> = Optional.Absent) {
  // ...
}
```

Meaning you can now create a new query from Java without having to specify `episode`: `new GetHeroQuery("1002")`

# Version 3.1.0

_2022-02-07_

Version 3.1.0 introduces new APIs for testing, mapping scalars as well a redesigned cache pipeline.
It also contains bugfixes around the `@include` directives, MemoryCache and GraphQL validation amongst other changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è [breaking] Fragment package name and `useSchemaPackageNameForFragments` (#3775)

If you're using `packageNamesFromFilePaths()`, the package name of generated fragment classes has changed.

Different generated types have different package names:

* Generated types coming from operations are generated based on the operation path
* Generated types coming from the schema (input objects, custom scalars and enums) are generated based on the schema
  path

Previously, fragments were using the schema path which is inconsistent because fragments are not defined in the schema
but are executable files, like operations.

Version 3.1.0 now uses the same logic for fragments as for operations. To revert to the previous behaviour, you can
use `useSchemaPackageNameForFragments`:

```kotlin
apollo {
  useSchemaPackageNameForFragments.set(true)
}
```

This is also done automatically if you're using `useVersion2Compat()`. Moving forward, the plan is to
remove `useSchemaPackageNameForFragments` in favor of setting a custom `PackageNameGenerator`. If you have use cases
that require `useSchemaPackageNameForFragments`,
please [reach out](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Aquestion%3A+Type%3A+Question&template=question.md&title=)
.

## ‚ú® [New] `QueueTestNetworkTransport` (#3757)

3.1.0 introduces `QueueTestNetworkTransport` to test at the GraphQL layer without needing to run an HTTP server.

To use it, configure your `ApolloClient`:

```kotlin
// This uses a QueueTestNetworkTransport that will play the queued responses
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .networkTransport(QueueTestNetworkTransport())
    .build()
```

You can then use the `enqueueTestResponse` extension function to specify the GraphQL responses to return:

```kotlin
val testQuery = GetHeroQuery("001")
val testData = GetHeroQuery.Data {
  hero = droidHero {
    name = "R2D2"
  }
}
apolloClient.enqueueTestResponse(testQuery, testData)
val actual = apolloClient.query(testQuery).execute().data!!
assertEquals(testData.hero.name, actual.hero.name)
```

## ‚ú® [New] `MockServerHandler` (#3757)

If you're testing at the HTTP layer, you can now define your own `MockServerHandler` to customize how the server is
going to answer to requests:

```kotlin
val customHandler = object : MockServerHandler {
  override fun handle(request: MockRequest): MockResponse {
    return if (/* Your custom logic here */) {
      MockResponse(
          body = """{"data": {"random": 42}}""",
          headers = mapOf("X-Test" to "true"),
      )
    } else {
      MockResponse(
          body = "Internal server error",
          statusCode = 500,
      )
    }
  }
}
val mockServer = MockServer(customHandler)
```

## ‚ú® [New] `FetchPolicy.CacheAndNetwork` (#3828)

Previously, `FetchPolicy`s were limited to policies that emitted at most **one** response. There was
a `executeCacheAndNetwork()` method but it felt asymmetrical. This version introduces `FetchPolicy.CacheAndNetwork` that
can emit up to two responses:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(query)
    // Check the cache and also use the network (1 or 2 values can be emitted)
    .fetchPolicy(FetchPolicy.CacheAndNetwork)
    // Execute the query and collect the responses
    .toFlow().collect { response ->
      // ...
    }
```

## ‚ú® [New] `ApolloCall<D>.fetchPolicyInterceptor(interceptor: ApolloInterceptor)` (#3743)

If you need more customized ways to fetch data from the cache or more fine-grained error handling that does not come
with the built-in `FetchPolicy`, you can now use `fetchPolicyInterceptor`:

```kotlin
// An, interceptor that will only use the network after getting a successful response
val refetchPolicyInterceptor = object : ApolloInterceptor {
  var hasSeenValidResponse: Boolean = false
  override fun <D : Operation.Data> intercept(
      request: ApolloRequest<D>,
      chain: ApolloInterceptorChain
  ): Flow<ApolloResponse<D>> {
    return if (!hasSeenValidResponse) {
      CacheOnlyInterceptor.intercept(request, chain).onEach {
        if (it.data != null) {
          // We have valid data, we can now use the network
          hasSeenValidResponse = true
        }
      }
    } else {
      // If for some reason we have a cache miss, get fresh data from the network
      CacheFirstInterceptor.intercept(request, chain)
    }
  }
}

apolloClient.query(myQuery)
    .refetchPolicyInterceptor(cacheOnlyInterceptor)
    .watch()
    .collect {
      //
    }
```

## ‚ú® [New] `Service.mapScalar` Gradle API (#3779)

You can now use `mapScalar` to specify your scalar mappings:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // Replace 
  customScalarsMapping.set(mapOf(
      "Date" to "java.util.Date"
  ))

  // With
  mapScalar("Date", "java.util.Date")
}
```

`mapScalar` also works with built-in scalar types so you can map the `ID` type to a kotlin Long:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // This requires registering an adapter at runtime with `addCustomScalarAdapter()` 
  mapScalar("ID", "kotlin.Long")
}
```

As an optimization, you can also provide the adapter at compile time. This will avoid a lookup at runtime everytime such
a scalar is read:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // No need to call `addCustomScalarAdapter()`, the generated code will use the provided adapter 
  mapScalar("ID", "kotlin.Long", "com.apollographql.apollo3.api.LongAdapter")
}
```

For convenience, a helper function is provided for common types:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // The generated code will use `kotlin.Long` and the builtin LongAdapter 
  mapScalarToKotlinLong("ID")

  // The generated code will use `kotlin.String` and the builtin StringAdapter
  mapScalarToKotlinString("Date")

  // The generated code will use `com.apollographql.apollo3.api.Upload` and the builtin UploadAdapter
  mapScalarToUpload("Upload")
}
```

## üöß [Changed] `convertApolloSchema` and `downloadApolloSchema` now use paths relative to the root of the project (#3773, #3752)

Apollo Kotlin adds two tasks to help to manage schemas: `convertApolloSchema` and `downloadApolloSchema`. These tasks
are meant to be used from the commandline.

Previously, paths were interpreted using the current working directory with `File(path)`. Unfortunately, this is
unreliable because Gradle might change the current working directory in some conditions (
see [Gradle#13927](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/13927)
or [Gradle#6074](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/6074) for an example).

With 3.1.0 and onwards, paths, will be interpreted relative to the root project
directory (`project.rootProject.file(path)`):

```
# schema is now interpreted relative to the root project directory and
# not the current working directory anymore. This example assumes there 
# is a 'app' module that applies the apollo plugin
./gradlew downloadApolloSchema \
  --endpoint="https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint" \
  --schema="app/src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls"
```

### Changes compared to `3.0.0-rc03`:

* Fix rewinding the Json stream when lists are involved (#3727)
* Kotlin 1.6.10 (#3723)
* Disable key fields check if unnecessary and optimize its perf (#3720)
* Added an easy way to log cache misses (#3724)
* Add a Data.toJson that uses reflection to lookup the adapter (#3719)
* Do not run the cache on the main thread (#3718)
* Promote JsonWriter extensions to public API (#3715)
* Make customScalarAdapters and subscriptionsNetworkTransport public (#3714)

# Version 3.0.0-rc03

_2021-12-13_

Compared to the previous RC, this version adds a few new convenience API and fixes 3 annoying issues.

üíô Many thanks to @ mateuszkwiecinski, @ schoeda and @ fn-jt for all the feedback üíô

## ‚ú® New APIs

- Make `ApolloCall.operation` public (#3698)
- Add `SubscriptionWsProtocolAdapter` (#3697)
- Add `Operation.composeJsonRequest` (#3697)

## ü™≤ Bug fixes

- Allow repeated `@fieldPolicy` (#3686)
- Fix incorrect merging of nested objects in JSON (#3672)
- Fix duplicate query detection (#3699)

# Version 3.0.0-rc02

_2021-12-10_

üíô Many thanks to @michgauz, @joeldenke, @rohandhruva, @schoeda, @CoreFloDev and @sproctor for all the feedback üíô

### ‚öôÔ∏è [breaking] Merge ApolloQueryCall, ApolloSubscriptionCall, ApolloMutationCall (#3676)

In order to simplify the API and keep the symmetry with `ApolloRequest<D>` and `ApolloResponse<D>`
, `ApolloQueryCall<D, E>`, `ApolloSubscriptionCall<D, E>`, `ApolloMutationCall<D, E>` are replaced with `ApolloCall<D>`.
This change should be mostly transparent but it's technically a breaking change. If you are
passing `ApolloQueryCall<D, E>` variables, it is safe to drop the second type parameter and use `ApolloCall<D>` instead.

### ‚ú® [New] Add `WebSocketNetworkTransport.reconnectWhen {}` (#3674)

You now have the option to reconnect a WebSocket automatically when an error happens and re-subscribe automatically
after the reconnection has happened. To do so, use the `webSocketReconnectWhen` parameter:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .httpServerUrl("http://localhost:8080/graphql")
    .webSocketServerUrl("http://localhost:8080/subscriptions")
    .wsProtocol(
        SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory(
            connectionPayload = {
              mapOf("token" to upToDateToken)
            }
        )
    )
    .webSocketReconnectWhen {
      // this is called when an error happens on the WebSocket
      it is ApolloWebSocketClosedException && it.code == 1001
    }
    .build()
```

### Better Http Batching API (#3670)

The `HttpBatchingEngine` has been moved to an `HttpInterceptor`. You can now configure Http batching with a specific
method:

```kotlin
apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl(mockServer.url())
    .httpBatching(batchIntervalMillis = 10)
    .build()
```

### All changes:

* Add 2.x symbols (`Rx2Apollo`, `prefetch()`, `customAttributes()`, `ApolloIdlingResource.create()`) to help the
  transition (#3679)
* Add canBeBatched var to ExecutionOptions (#3677)
* Merge ApolloQueryCall, ApolloSubscriptionCall, ApolloMutationCall (#3676)
* Add `WebSocketNetworkTransport.reconnectWhen {}` (#3674)
* Move BatchingHttpEngine to a HttpInterceptor (#3670)
* Add exposeErrorBody (#3661)
* fix the name of the downloadServiceApolloSchemaFromRegistry task (#3669)
* Fix DiskLruHttpCache concurrency (#3667)

# Version 3.0.0-rc01

_2021-12-07_

This version is the release candidate for Apollo Android 3 üöÄ. Please try it
and [report any issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/issues/new/choose), we'll fix them urgently.

There is [documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/) and
a [migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/migration/3.0/). More details are coming soon. In a
nutshell, Apollo Android 3 brings, amongst other things:

* [coroutine APIs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/essentials/queries/) for easier concurrency
* [multiplatform support](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/kotlin-native/) makes it possible to run
  the same code on Android, JS, iOS, MacOS and linux
* [responseBased codegen](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/response-based-codegen/) is a new optional
  codegen that models fragments as interfaces
* SQLite batching makes reading from the SQLite cache significantly faster
* [Test builders](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/test-builders/) offer a simple APIs to build fake
  models for your tests
* [The @typePolicy and @fieldPolicy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/caching/declarative-ids/) directives
  make it easier to define your cache ids at compile time
* [The @nonnull](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/nonnull/) directive catches null values at parsing
  time, so you don't have to deal with them in your UI code

Compared to `beta05`, this version changes the default value of `generateOptionalOperationVariables`, is compatible with
Gradle configuration cache and fixes a few other issues.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API changes

### Optional operation variables (#3648) (breaking)

The default value for the `generateOptionalOperationVariables` config is now `true`.

What this means:

- By default, operations with nullable variables will be generated with `Optional` parameters
- You will need to wrap your parameters at the call site

For instance:

```graphql
query GetTodos($first: Int, $offset: Int) {
  todos(first: $first, offset: $offset) {
    ...Todo
  }
}
```

```kotlin
// Before
val query = GetTodosQuery(100, null)

// After
val query = GetTodosQuery(Optional.Present(100), Optional.Absent)

```

- If you prefer, you can set `generateOptionalOperationVariables` to `false` to generate non-optional parameters
  globally
- This can also be controlled on individual variables with the `@optional` directive
- More information about this can be
  found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/operation-variables/)

We think this change will make more sense to the majority of users (and is consistent with Apollo Android v2's behavior)
even though it may be more verbose, which is why it is possible to change the behavior via
the `generateOptionalOperationVariables` config.

To keep the `beta05` behavior, set `generateOptionalOperationVariables` to false in your Gradle configuration:

```
apollo {
  generateOptionalOperationVariables.set(false)
}
```

### ApolloClient.Builder improvements (#3647)

You can now pass WebSocket related options to the `ApolloClient.Builder` directly (previously this would have been done
via `NetworkTransport`):

```kotlin
// Before
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    // (...)
    .subscriptionNetworkTransport(WebSocketNetworkTransport(
        serverUrl = "https://example.com/graphql",
        idleTimeoutMillis = 1000L,
        wsProtocol = SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory()
    ))
    .build()

// After
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    // (...)
    .wsProtocol(SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory())
    .webSocketIdleTimeoutMillis(1000L)
    .build()
```

### Upgrade to OkHttp 4 (#3653) (breaking)

This version upgrades OkHttp to `4.9.3` (from `3.12.11`). This means Apollo Android now requires Android `apiLevel` `21`
+. As OkHttp 3 enters end of life at the end of the year and the vast majority of devices now support `apiLevel` `21`,
we felt this was a reasonable upgrade.

## ü™≤ Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to restart a websocket after a network error (#3646)
- Fixed an issue where Android Java projects could not use the Apollo Gradle plugin (#3652)

## üë∑ All Changes

- Update a few dependencies (#3653)
- Fix Android Java projects (#3652)
- Expose more configuration options on ApolloClient.Builder (#3647)
- Fix restarting a websocket after a network error (#3646)
- Change optional default value (#3648)
- Fix configuration cache (#3645)
