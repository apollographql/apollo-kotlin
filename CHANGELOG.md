# Version 3.0.0-rc01

_2021-12-07_

This version is the release candidate for Apollo Android 3 üöÄ. Please try it and [report any issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/issues/new/choose), we'll fix them urgently.

There is [documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3) and a [migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3/migration/3.0/). More details are coming soon. In a nutshell, Apollo Android 3 brings, amongst other things:

* [coroutine APIs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3/essentials/queries/) for easier concurrency
* [multiplatform support](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3/advanced/kotlin-native/) makes it possible to run the same code on Android, JS, iOS, MacOS and linux
* [responseBased codegen](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3/advanced/response-based-codegen/) is a new optional codegen that models fragments as interfaces
* SQLite batching makes reading from the SQLite cache significantly faster
* [Test builders](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3/advanced/test-builders/) offer a simple APIs to build fake models for your tests
* [The @typePolicy and @fieldPolicy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3/caching/declarative-ids/) directives make it easier to define your cache ids at compile time
* [The @nonnull](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3/advanced/nonnull/) directive catches null values at parsing time, so you don't have to deal with them in your UI code


Compared to `beta05`, this version changes the default value of `generateOptionalOperationVariables`, is compatible with Gradle configuration cache and fixes a few other issues.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API changes

### Optional operation variables (#3648) (breaking)

The default value for the `generateOptionalOperationVariables` config is now `true`.

What this means:

- By default, operations with nullable variables will be generated with `Optional` parameters
- You will need to wrap your parameters at the call site

For instance:

```graphql
query GetTodos($first: Int, $offset: Int) {
  todos(first: $first, offset: $offset) {
    ...Todo
  }
}
```

```kotlin
// Before
val query = GetTodosQuery(100, null)

// After
val query = GetTodosQuery(Optional.Present(100), Optional.Absent)

```

- If you prefer, you can set `generateOptionalOperationVariables` to `false` to generate non-optional parameters globally
- This can also be controlled on individual variables with the `@optional` directive
- More information about this can be found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3/advanced/operation-variables/)

We think this change will make more sense to the majority of users (and is consistent with Apollo Android v2's behavior) even though it may be more verbose, which is why it is possible to change the behavior via the `generateOptionalOperationVariables` config.

To keep the `beta05` behavior, set `generateOptionalOperationVariables` to false in your Gradle configuration:

```
apollo {
  generateOptionalOperationVariables.set(false)
}
```

### ApolloClient.Builder improvements (#3647)

You can now pass WebSocket related options to the `ApolloClient.Builder` directly (previously this would have been done via `NetworkTransport`):

```kotlin
// Before
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    // (...)
    .subscriptionNetworkTransport(WebSocketNetworkTransport(
        serverUrl = "https://example.com/graphql",
        idleTimeoutMillis = 1000L,
        wsProtocol = SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory()
    ))
    .build()

// After
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    // (...)
    .wsProtocol(SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory())
    .webSocketIdleTimeoutMillis(1000L)
    .build()
```

### Upgrade to OkHttp 4 (#3653) (breaking)

This version upgrades OkHttp to `4.9.3` (from `3.12.11`). This means Apollo Android now requires Android `apiLevel` `21`+. As OkHttp 3 enters end of life at the end of the year and the vast majority of devices now support `apiLevel` `21`, we felt this was a reasonable upgrade.

## ü™≤ Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to restart a websocket after a network error (#3646)
- Fixed an issue where Android Java projects could not use the Apollo Gradle plugin (#3652)


## üë∑ All Changes

- Update a few dependencies (#3653)
- Fix Android Java projects (#3652)
- Expose more configuration options on ApolloClient.Builder (#3647)
- Fix restarting a websocket after a network error (#3646)
- Change optional default value (#3648)
- Fix configuration cache (#3645)
