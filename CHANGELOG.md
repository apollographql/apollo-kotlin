# Version 4.1.0

_2024-11-04_

## Ktor 3.0.0

Version 4.1.0 updates usages of Ktor from 2.3.11 to 3.0.0:

* If you are using `apollo-runtime-js` or `apollo-debug-server-jvm`, you need to update your app to Ktor 3.0.0+ at the same time as updating to Apollo 4.1.0 (`apollo-debug-server-android` is unaffected).
* If you are using the deprecated `apollo-mockserver` or `apollo-ktor-support` from this repo, you need to update to the [new coordinates](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/migration/4.0#moved-artifacts).

All other cases are unaffected. In particular, `apollo-runtime` on Android and iOS uses OkHttp and NsUrlConnection respectively and is not impacted by the Ktor update.

You can read more details in the [pull request](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/6214).

### New media type: `application/graphql-response+json`

`application/graphql-response+json` is a new media type being introduced by the [GraphQL over HTTP draft](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-over-http/draft/). It allows differentiating a valid GraphQL response from an error JSON response that could be transmitted by a cache or proxy in the HTTP chain. 

If your server uses `application/graphql-response+json` and returns non-2xx response, Apollo Kotlin will now parse those responses and expose `data` and `errors` instead of returning an `ApolloHttpException` before.

### K2 support for the IntelliJ plugin

The IntelliJ plugin is now compatible with K2 (#6150)

# Version 4.0.1

_2024-10-01_

This release contains a handful of bug fixes and improvements. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Add `ApolloCompilerPlugin.schemaListener()`

The [compiler plugins](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/compiler-plugins) API has been extended to allow listening to schema changes.\
This can be used to have plugins generate code based on the schema. To do this, implement the [`schemaListener`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/kdoc/apollo-compiler/com.apollographql.apollo.compiler/-apollo-compiler-plugin/schema-listener.html)
function on your plugin:
    
```kotlin
class MyCompilerPlugin() : ApolloCompilerPlugin {
  @ApolloExperimental
  override fun schemaListener(): SchemaListener {
    return object : SchemaListener {
      override fun onSchema(schema: Schema, outputDirectory: File) {
        // Generate some code inside outputDirectory based on schema
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Allow mapping scalars to simple generic types

Previously, to [map a scalar](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/essentials/custom-scalars) to a generic type, you had to use a `typealias`. 
Now, simple generic types are accepted, and common types like `List` and `String` don't need to be fully qualified:

```kotlin
mapScalar("MassList", "List<com.example.Measure<com.example.Mass>>", "com.example.MassListAdapter")
```

# Version 4.0.0

_2024-07-29_

Apollo Kotlin 4 is a maturity release. It focuses on tooling, stability and making the library more maintainable, so it can evolve smoothly for the many years to come.

While most of the core APIs stayed the same, Apollo Kotlin 4 contains a few binary breaking changes. To account for that, and in order to be more future-proof, we changed the package name to `com.apollographql.apollo`.

You'll need to replace all the `com.apollographql.apollo3` with `com.apollographql.apollo` in your codebase.

* Migration guide: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/migration/4.0.
* Evolution policy: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/essentials/evolution.
* Blog post: coming soon.

Thanks again to everyone who provided feedback during the alphas/betas.

# Version 4.0.0-rc.2

_2024-07-22_

We're on the road to v4 with this second release candidate which includes a few minor tweaks as well as one new feature.

Note: in v4.0.0-rc.1 `apollo-debug-server` and `apollo-tooling` depended on `com.apollographql.apollo3` artifacts. This is no longer the case with `v4.0.0-rc.2`,
where all dependencies are under the `com.apollographql.apollo` group id.

## Add memoryCacheOnly (#6049)

`.memoryCacheOnly(true)` can be set on calls to read and store records in the memory cache only even when a persistent cache is configured.
This can be useful in scenarios where long term storage isn't needed and performance is important.

* [gradle-plugin] Use a better warning for Service.schemaFile users (#6036)
* [all] Update apollo-kotlin-execution (#6040)
* [IJ Plugin] Add com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-api-jvm to dependencySupport (#6039)
* [all] Update to Gradle 8.9 (#6056)
* [gradle-plugin] Undeprecate schemaFile (#6055)
* [gradle-plugin] Disable service-loading `ApolloCompilerPlugin` (#6059)

# Version 3.8.5

_2024-07-10_

Version 3.8.5 is a maintenance release. New developments happen in the 4.x versions.

* [all] Bump okio to 3.9.0 (#5868)
* [runtime] Adding checks for json end_document in http transport (#5894)
* [runtime] Adding checks for json end_document in http batching interceptors (#5892)
* [codegen] Fix mapping of the builtin Float scalar type (#6047)
* [normalized-cache] SqlNormalizedCacheFactory make sqldriver public to support Sqlcipher data encryption. (#5972)

# Version 4.0.0-rc.1

_2024-07-08_

## New package name & evolution policy

We changed the package name from `com.apollographql.apollo3` to `com.apollographql.apollo` for version 4. This is a safe default for the many years to come and works well with our new [evolution policy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/essentials/evolution).

If you are updating from version 3 or an alpha/beta version 4, you need to replace all `com.apollographql.apollo3` with `com.apollographql.apollo`

## Apollo galaxy

As part of this release, some of the non-core artifacts have been moved to separate coordinates and GitHub repositories. Moving forward, this will allow us to iterate faster on those artifacts while keeping the core ones more maintainable.

Some of the existing symbols are kept as deprecated to ease the transition (like `MockServer` for an example). Others (the `-incubating` ones) have been removed, and you need to update them now.

You can read more in the [migration guide](https://go.apollo.dev/ak-moved-artifacts).

# Version 4.0.0-beta.6

_2024-04-23_

## SQL cache performance improvements

If you're using a chained memory + SQL cache, #5840 makes sure cache writes are wrapped in a transaction, making them much faster.

## Apollo Compiler Plugins

`Plugin` is renamed to `ApolloCompilerPlugin`. There is a new `documentTransform` API as well as other fixes. More details in the [compiler plugins documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/advanced/compiler-plugins).

## Experimental WebSockets

A new `.websocket` package is available that makes it easier to retry WebSockets and handle errors. More details and migration guide in the [experimental websockets documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/advanced/experimental-websockets).

## ApolloIdlingResource is deprecated

We recommend using reactive patterns to test your UI instead. See [this article about ways to do so](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/alternatives-to-idling-resources-in-compose-tests-8ae71f9fc473).

## Removed androidx.startup dependency

androidx.startup was introduced in beta.5 but is problematic for unit tests and other cases. beta.6 removes that dependency. More details in the [network connectivity documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/advanced/network-connectivity).

##  WasmJS support for apollo-adapter

You can see Wasm in action at https://wasm.confetti-app.dev/ 

##  Threading changes

In a effort to minimize the number of thread switches, the whole request is now run in the same dispatcher. See [Threading.md](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/blob/39d76630277476004bbaed0e3a897feb5a959084/design-docs/Threading.md) for more details.

# Version 3.8.3

_2024-03-20_

Version 3.8.3 is a maintenance release with two new convenience APIs and a Kotlin update. New developments happen in the 4.x versions.

Note: because Apollo Kotlin now depends on kotlin-stdlib version 1.9, you need the 1.8+ Kotlin compiler to compile your project.

* [all] update Kotlin to 1.9 (#5412)
* [runtime] Add `ApolloClient.Builder(ApolloHttpCache)` (#5638) (#5640)
* [runtime] Allow `buildPostBody` to write operation extensions (#5631)

* [http-cache] Ignore `IOException` when calling `ApolloHttpCache.remove` (#5730)
* [all] Add deprecations on symbols that are getting removed in v4 (#5746)

# Version 4.0.0-beta.5

_2024-03-12_

Main changes:

* **Apollo compiler plugins**: The GraphQL compiler now has APIs that you can use to customize the generated code. This can be used for changing visibility of some symbols, renaming them or more generally customizing the output for any advanced use cases. Moving forward, Apollo compiler plugins are the preferred way to customize operation IDs as well as package names and both `PackageNameGenerator` and `OperationOutputGenerator` are deprecated. See the [documentation page about Apollo compiler plugins](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/advanced/compiler-plugins) for more details.
* **Reduced lock contention in apollo-normalized-cache-incubating**: the incubating normalized cache now uses lock-free memory structures inspired by guava and [MobileNativeFoundation/Store](https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/Store/). We have seen improvements by up to 20% in some scenarios. Please share your numbers if you notice any positive (or negative) change. 
* **Nullability directives**: The version of the supported nullability directives was bumped from 0.1 to 0.3 (See [apollographql/specs#42](https://github.com/apollographql/specs/pull/42) and [apollographql/specs#48](https://github.com/apollographql/specs/pull/48)). If you are using `@semanticNonNull` or `@catch` you should bump your `@link` directives to use `0.3`. See the [nullability documentation page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/advanced/nullability) for more details.
* **New snapshot repository for the IntelliJ/Android Studio plugin**: The repository to use for the weekly snapshots has changed. You can now use `https://go.apollo.dev/ij-plugin-snapshots` to get the latest weekly snapshots. ([#5600](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/5600))
* **Multi-version KDoc**: The [published KDoc](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/kdoc/index.html) now includes both v3 and v4 versions.

Many thanks to @ribafish, @molundb, @mboyd1993, @rohandhruva and @baconz for their help in this release üíô!

# Version 4.0.0-beta.4

_2023-12-12_

## ‚ú® Initial Wasm support (#5458)

This release adds initial support for WebAssembly by adding the `wasmJs` target.

Executing queries/mutations is working but this target is
experimental ([Kotlin/Wasm](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/wasm-overview.html) is Alpha) and has multiple limitations:

- No WebSockets
- No caching
- No support for WASI or NodeJS

## ü™≤ Bug fix

Downloading a schema from introspection (`./gradlew downloadServiceSchemaFromIntrospection`) got broken in the previous
release (#5449) and is now fixed.

# Version 4.0.0-beta.3

_2023-12-05_

Many thanks @chris-hatton and @sdfgsdfgd for contributing this version üíô

## üß© IDE plugin: in-memory cache support

The normalized cache viewer can now display the contents of your in-memory cache. To do so, it relies on a
debug server that you need to run in your debug builds:

```kotlin

val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
    .build()

if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
  ApolloDebugServer.registerApolloClient(apolloClient)
}
```

You can read more about it [in the "Apollo debug server" documentation page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/testing/apollo-debug-server).

## Experimental `@catch` and `@semanticNonNull` support

`@catch` makes it possible to model GraphQL errors as `FieldResult` Kotlin classes giving you inline access to errors:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user {
    id
    # map name to FieldResult<String?> instead of stopping the parsing
    name @catch
    avatarUrl
  }
}
```

`@semanticNonNull` is a better `@nonnull`. `@semanticNonNull` makes it possible to mark a field as null only on error. The matching Kotlin property is then generated as non-null:

```graphql
# mark User.name as semantically non-null
extend type User @semanticNonNull(field: "name")
```

Both those directives are experimental and require opt-in of the [nullability directives](https://github.com/apollographql/specs/pull/36)

You can read more about them [in the "handle nullability" documentation page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/advanced/nullability).

## Experimental `@oneOf` support

`@oneOf` introduces input polymorphism to GraphQL:

```graphql
input PetInput @oneOf {
  cat: CatInput
  dog: DogInput
  fish: FishInput
}

input CatInput { name: String!, numberOfLives: Int }
input DogInput { name: String!, wagsTail: Boolean }
input FishInput { name: String!, bodyLengthInMm: Int }

type Mutation {
  addPet(pet: PetInput!): Pet
}
```

With `@oneOf`, only one of `cat`, `dog` or `fish` can be set. 

`@oneOf` support is automatically enabled if your schema has the `@oneOf` directive definition.

You can read more about it [in the `@oneOf` RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/825)

# Version 4.0.0-beta.2

_2023-10-23_

We're continuing to progress towards the stable release of Apollo Kotlin v4 with this 2nd beta, which contains a few bug
fixes and a new normalized cache viewer in the IDE plugin.

This is a great time to try out the new version and report any issues you might find!

## üß© IDE plugin: normalized cache viewer

The IDE plugin now has a graphical tool to inspect a normalized cache database. It lets you browse the records and see
their contents.
This is useful to debug cache issues, or to understand how the normalized cache works.

The tool is available from `View` | `Tool Windows` | `Apollo Normalized Cache`.

More information about the plugin can be
found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/testing/android-studio-plugin).

# Version 4.0.0-beta.1

_2023-10-02_

The first beta of the next major version of Apollo Kotlin is here!

While there still may be a few API changes before the stable release, we are getting close and this is a great time to try out the new version and report any issues you might find!

## üíôÔ∏è External contributors

Many thanks to @baconz and @hbmartin for their awesome contributions to this release! 

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Schema Nullability Extensions (#5191)

The GraphQL community [is working hard at making it easier to work with nullability in GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/client-controlled-nullability-wg/). 

In Apollo Kotlin, it is now possible to change the nullability of fields _and_ list elements at the schema level using schema extensions. This is useful if you believe the schema made a field nullable for error reasons only and you don't want to handle those errors. In these cases, the whole query will return as an error.

Given the following SDL:
```graphql
# schema.graphqls
type Query {
  random: Int
  list: [String]
  required: Int!
}
```

You can extend it like so:
```graphql
# extra.graphqls
extend type Query {
  # make random non-nullable
  random: Int!
  # make list and list items non-nullable
  list: [String!]!
  # make required nullable
  required: Int
  # add a new field
  new: Float
}
```

## üìúÔ∏è Code generation

### `generateMethods` option to control which model methods are generated (#5212)

By default all Kotlin models, operations, fragments, and input objects are generated as data classes. This means that the Kotlin compiler will
auto-generate `toString`, `equals` `hashCode`, `copy` and `componentN`. If you don't think you need all of those
methods, and/or you are worried about the size of the generated code, you can now choose which methods to generate with the `generateMethods` option:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    // Generates equals/hashCode
    generateMethods.set(listOf("equalsHashCode"))
    // Also generates toString, equals, and hashcode
    generateMethods.set(listOf("equalsHashCode", "toString"))
    // Only generates copy
    generateMethods.set(listOf("copy"))
    // Generates data classes (the default)
    generateMethods.set(listOf("dataClass"))
  }
}
```

### Other codegen tweaks

* `Enum.values()` is no longer recommended when using Kotlin 1.9+ and the generated code now uses `entries` instead (#5208)
* Deprecation warnings in generated code are suppressed (#5242)

## üß© IntelliJ plugin

* You can now suppress reported unused fields, by adding a comment on the field, or by configuring a regex in the settings (#5195, #5197)
* Opening an operation in Sandbox now includes all referenced fragments (#5236)

## ü™≤ Bug fixes 

* Detect cyclic fragment references (#5229)
* Fix `Optional<V>.getOrThrow()` when V is nullable (#5192)
* `useV3ExceptionHandling` only throws when there are no errors populated (#5231)
* Tweak the `urlEncode` algorithm (#5234)
* Add a validation for adding `keyFields` on non-existent fields (#5215)
* Fix logging when the response body is a single line (#5254)

# Version 4.0.0-alpha.3

_2023-08-08_

A lot of additions to the [IntelliJ plugin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/testing/android-studio-plugin) as well as a new GraphQL parser, a new Ktor multiplatform engine and more!

## üíô External contributors üíô

Apollo Kotlin wouldn't be where it is today without the awesome feedback, discussions and contributions from community members. Specifically in this release, we want to give a huge THANK YOU to: @Emplexx, @sonatard, @yt8492, @mayakoneval, @Meschreiber, @pcarrier and @ashare80

## üß© IntelliJ plugin 

### üëì Unused field inspection (#5069)

The IntelliJ plugin now detects unused fields in your queries and greys them out:

https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/assets/372852/6a573a78-4a07-4294-8fa5-92a9ebb02e6c

## v4 migration

The IntelliJ plugin can migrate most of your codebase to v4. To try it out, go to:

`Tools` -> `Apollo` -> `Migrate to Apollo Kotlin 4`

Because Kotlin is such a rich language and we can't account for all possible ways to configure your build, you might have to do some manual tweaks after the migration. But the plugin should handle most of the repetitive tasks of migrating.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Schema download (#5143)

If you configured introspection, you can now download your schema directly from IntelliJ

<img src="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/assets/372852/3a15f587-b057-4df5-82c0-2e0b0247c203" width=250/>

### üìñ documentation

The IntelliJ plugin now has its [own dedicated documentation page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/testing/android-studio-plugin). 

Consult it to find out everything you can do with the plugin as well as installation instructions.


## üå≥ Multiplatform Apollo AST (#5047)

Apollo AST, the GraphQL parser powering Apollo Kotlin is now a manually written recursive descent parser, compared to an automatically generated [Antlr](https://www.antlr.org/) parser before. 
[Benchmarks](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/5047) show a x2 to x3 speed improvement and the parser also now supports all platforms Apollo Kotlin supports.

## ‚ùó‚ùì Initial Client Controlled Nullability (CCN) support (#5118)

[Client Controlled Nullability (CCN)](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/ClientControlledNullability.md) is a GraphQL specification RFC aiming at making it easier to work with GraphQL in type safe languages like Kotlin and Swift.

To use CCN, use the `!` and `?` CCN modifiers in your queries:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user {
    id
    # name is required to display the user
    name!
    # phoneNumber is optional
    phoneNumber?
  }
}
```

The RFC is still in early stages and requires server support. The API and final shape of the RFC might still change. By adding support in Apollo Kotlin, we're hoping to unblock potential users and gather real life feedbacks helping the proposal move forward.

## üì° Ktor engine (#5142)

Apollo Kotlin now ships a `apollo-engine-ktor` that you can use to replace the default HTTP and WebSocket engines of ApolloClient. To use it, add `apollo-engine-ktor` to your dependencies:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-engine-ktor")
}
```

And configure your client to use it:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
    .httpEngine(KtorHttpEngine())
    .webSocketEngine(KtorWebSocketEngine())
    .build()
```

## üë∑ `generateInputBuilders` (#5146)

For Kotlin codegen, Apollo Kotlin relied on constructors with [default arguments](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/functions.html#default-arguments). While this works well in most cases, default arguments lack the ability to distinguish between `null` and `absent` meaning you have to wrap your values in `Optional` before passing them to your constructor. If you had a lot of values, it could be cumbersome:

```kotlin
val input = SignupMemberInput(
    dob = Utils.changeDateFormat(user.dobMMDDYYYY, "MM/dd/yyyy", "yyyy-MM-dd"),
    firstName = Optional.Present(user.firstName),
    lastName = user.lastName,
    ssLast4 = Optional.Present(user.ssnLastFour),
    email = user.email,
    cellPhone = Optional.Present(user.phone),
    password = user.password,
    acceptedTos = true,
    formIds = Optional.Present(formIds),
    medium = Optional.Present(ConsentMediumEnum.android)
)
```

To generate Kotlin Builders, set `generateInputBuilders` to true in your Gradle file:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("api") {
    packageName.set("com.example")

    generateInputBuilders.set(true)
  }
}
```

With Builders, the same above code can be written in a more fluent way:

```kotlin
val input = SignupMemberInput.builder().apply {
    dob(Utils.changeDateFormat(user.dobMMDDYYYY, "MM/dd/yyyy", "yyyy-MM-dd"))
    firstName(user.firstName)
    lastName(user.lastName)
    ssLast4(user.ssnLastFour)
    email(user.email)
    cellPhone(user.phone)
    password(user.password)
    acceptedTos(true)
    formIds(formIds)
    medium(ConsentMediumEnum.ANDROID)
}.build()
```

_2023-06-30_

## üß©Navigate to GraphQL

You can now navigate from Kotlin both GraphQL or Generated code:

https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/assets/3974977/acd4bf34-db35-4442-a7af-b6151701620c

See [blog the blog post](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/mobile/kotlin/announcing-the-apollo-kotlin-plugin-for-android-studio-and-intellij-idea/) and [installation instructions](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/blob/main/intellij-plugin/README.md#installation-instructions) for more information.

## üß©Field insights

You can now connect the IJ/AS plugin to your GraphOS account. If your backend is configured to report field traces, the plugin will display a warning for expensive fields that may be slow to fetch.

![Field insights](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/assets/3974977/efb9e813-bcc4-4b0f-99ed-f32257c28b14)

You can configure it in your IJ/AS settings `Languages & Frameworks` -> `GraphQL` -> `Apollo Kotlin`. See also [#5048](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/5048) for a video of the setup.

## üåê`@jsExport`

`responseBased` codegen can now generate models annotated with [@jsExport](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.js/-js-export/). This allows to fetch your response using faster JS-only APIs and cast them to the generated models. See [the JS interoperability documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/advanced/js-interop#jsexport) for more information. Many thanks to @baconz for the deep dive üíô

# Version 4.0.0-alpha.1

_2023-05-16_

This release is the first alpha of the next major version of Apollo Kotlin: 4.0.0. 

This version is under development, but we want to give you a preview of what's coming, and get your early feedback. Please see the [roadmap](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for more details about the release plan.

While version 3 changed a lot of APIs compared to version 2, version 4 should be mostly compatible with version 3. Version 4 will even keep the same package name in order to keep the number of changes low.

The error handling has changed but besides that, the version should be mostly compatible. Please consult the [migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/migration/4.0) for all the details.

We would love to hear your feedback on this release. Please report any issues, questions, ideas, or comments on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues).

## üõ†Ô∏è Android Studio / IntelliJ plugin

See [this page](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/tree/main/intellij-plugin) for installation instructions and more information.

This plugin for Android Studio and IntelliJ helps you work with Apollo Kotlin. It provides the following features:

- Automatic code generation
- Integration with the [GraphQL IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8097-js-graphql)
- Navigation to GraphQL definitions
- Helpers to migrate your project to the latest version

## ‚ö°Ô∏è `ApolloResponse.exception` for error handling

Error handling is an important aspect of a client library and we found it could benefit from some changes.

In particular we are moving away from throwing exceptions:
- This improves dealing with Flows as they will no longer terminate on errors
- It helps grouping all error handling (network, GraphQL, caching) in the same area of your code

To that effect, there is now an `ApolloResponse.exception : ApolloException` property, which will be present when a network error or cache miss have occurred, or when GraphQL errors are present:

```kotlin
val data = response.data
when {
  data != null -> {
    println("The server returned data: $data")
  }
  else -> {
    // An error happened, check response.exception for more details or just display a generic error 
    when (response.exception) {
      is ApolloGraphQLException -> // do something with exception.errors
      is ApolloHttpException -> // do something with exception.statusCode
      is ApolloNetworkException -> TODO()
      is ApolloParseException -> TODO()
      else -> // generic error
    }
  }
}
```

To ease the migration to v4, the v3 behavior can be restored by calling `ApolloClient.Builder.useV3ExceptionHandling(true)`.

Feedback about this change is welcome on [issue 4711](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/4711).

## ‚òïÔ∏è `apollo-runtime-java` for better Java support

As v3 has a Kotlin and Coroutines first API, using it from Java is sometimes impractical or not idiomatic. That is why in v4 we are introducing a new Java runtime, written in Java, which provides a Java friendly API. It is callback based and doesn't depend on a third-party library like Rx.

To use it in your project, instead of the usual runtime (`com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime`), use the following dependency in your `build.gradle[.kts]` file:

```kotlin
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime-java")
```

Then you can use the `ApolloClient` class from Java:

```java
ApolloClient apolloClient = new ApolloClient.Builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .build();

apolloClient
  .query(MyQuery.builder().build())
  .enqueue(new ApolloCallback<MyQuery.Data>() {
      @Override public void onResponse(@NotNull ApolloResponse<MyQuery.Data> response) {
        System.out.prinitln(response.getData());
      }
  });
```

A few examples can be found in the [tests](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/tree/main/tests/java-client/src/test/java/test).

## üîÉ Multi-module: automatic detection of used types

In multi-module projects, by default, all the types of an upstream module are generated because there is no way to know in advance what types are going to be used by downstream modules. For large projects this can lead to a lot of unused code and an increased build time.

To avoid this, in v3 you could manually specify which types to generate by using `alwaysGenerateTypesMatching`. In v4 this can now be computed automatically by detecting which types are used by the downstream modules.

To enable this, add the "opposite" link of dependencies with `isADependencyOf()`.

```kotlin
// schema/build.gradle.kts
apollo {
  service("service") {
    packageName.set("schema")

    // Enable generation of metadata for use by downstream modules 
    generateApolloMetadata.set(true)

    // More options...

    // Get used types from the downstream module
    isADependencyOf(project(":feature1"))

    // You can have several downstream modules
    isADependencyOf(project(":feature2"))
  }
}
```

```kotlin
// feature1/build.gradle.kts
apollo {
  service("service") {
    packageName.set("feature1")
    
    // Get the generated schema types (and fragments) from the upstream schema module 
    dependsOn(project(":schema")) 
  }
}
```

# Version 3.8.0

_2023-03-28_

This release adds two new artifacts that contain Jetpack compose extensions amongst other fixes.

## üíôÔ∏è External contributors

Many thanks to @slinstacart and @hbmartin for their contributions to this release!

## ‚ú® [New] Jetpack compose extension (#4802)

You can now use the `apollo-compose-support` artifact: 

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-compose-support")
}
```

This artifact contains the `toState()` and `watchAsState()` extensions:

```kotlin
/**
 * A stateful composable that retrieves your data
 */
@OptIn(ApolloExperimental::class)
@Composable
fun LaunchDetails(launchId: String) {
    val response by apolloClient.query(LaunchDetailsQuery(launchId)).toState()
    val r = response
    when {
        r == null -> Loading() // no response yet
        r.exception != null -> ErrorMessage("Oh no... A network error happened: ${r.exception!!.message}")
        r.hasErrors() -> ErrorMessage("Oh no... A GraphQL error happened ${r.errors[0].message}.")
        else -> LaunchDetails(r.data!!, navigateToLogin)
    }
}

/**
 * A stateless composable that displays your data
 */
@Composable
private fun LaunchDetails(
        data: LaunchDetailsQuery.Data,
) {
  // Your UI code goes here
}
```

If you are working with paginated data, you can also add `apollo-compose-paging-support` to your dependencies:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-compose-paging-support")
}
```

This artifact contains a helper function to create `androidx.pagin.Pager` instances ([androix documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/paging/Pager)):

```kotlin
@OptIn(ApolloExperimental::class)
@Composable
fun LaunchList(onLaunchClick: (launchId: String) -> Unit) {
  val lazyPagingItems = rememberAndCollectPager<LaunchListQuery.Data, LaunchListQuery.Launch>(
          config = PagingConfig(pageSize = 10),
          appendCall = { response, loadSize ->
            if (response?.data?.launches?.hasMore == false) {
              // No more pages
              null
            } else {
              // Compute the next call from the current response
              apolloClient.query(
                      LaunchListQuery(
                              cursor = Optional.present(response?.data?.launches?.cursor),
                              pageSize = Optional.present(loadSize)
                      )
              )
            }
          },
          getItems = { response ->
            // Compute the items to be added to the page from the current response
            if (response.hasErrors()) {
              Result.failure(ApolloException(response.errors!![0].message))
            } else {
              Result.success(response.data!!.launches.launches.filterNotNull())
            }
          },
  )
  
  // Use your paging items:
  if (lazyPagingItems.loadState.refresh is LoadState.Loading) {
    Loading()
  } else {
    LazyColumn {
      items(lazyPagingItems) { launch ->
        // Your UI code goes here
      }
      item {
        when (val append = lazyPagingItems.loadState.append) {
          is LoadState.Error -> // Add error indicator here 
          LoadState.Loading -> // Add loading indicator here
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚ú® [New] Gradle plugin: run codegen after gradle sync

If you import a new project or run a Gradle sync, your GraphQL models are now automatically generated so that the IDE can find the symbols and your files do not show red underlines. This takes into account Gradle up-to-date checks and it should be pretty fast. If you want to opt-out, you can do so with `generateSourcesDuringGradleSync.set(false)`:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // Enable automatic generation of models during Gradle sync (default)
  generateSourcesDuringGradleSync.set(true)

  // Or disable automatic generation of models to save on your Gradle sync times
  generateSourcesDuringGradleSync.set(false)

  service("api") {
    // Your  GraphQL configuration
  }
}
```

Many thanks to @StefanChmielewski and @chao2zhang for contributing to the project! üß°

## ‚öôÔ∏è Removed JS legacy artifacts (#4591)

Historically, Kotlin Multiplatform has had 2 formats of JS artifacts: [Legacy and IR](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-ir-compiler.html), and Apollo Kotlin has been publishing both. However, the Legacy format is about to [be deprecated with Kotlin 1.8](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew-eap.html#kotlin-js) and moreover we've seen [issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/4590) when using the Legacy artifact in the browser. That is why starting with this release, only the IR artifacts will be published. Please reach out if this causes any issue in your project.

_2022-12-05_

This patch release brings a few fixes.

Many thanks to @davidshepherd7, @chao2zhang, @agrosner, @MyDogTom, @doucheng, @sam43 and @vincentjames501, for helping improve the library! üôè

## üîé‚Äç Explicit service declaration

Apollo Kotlin can be configured to work with [multiple services](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/plugin-configuration/#using-multiple-graphql-apis) and have the package name, schema files location, and other options specified for each of them. When using a single service however it is possible to omit the `service` block and set the options directly in the `apollo` block - in that case, a default service named `service` is automatically defined.

While this saves a few lines, it relies on Gradle `afterEvaluate {}` block that makes the execution of the plugin less predictable and more subject to race conditions with other plugins (see [here](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/4523#issuecomment-1324715590) for an example).

What's more, as we move more logic to build time, the name of the service is going to be used more and more in generated code. Since [explicit is better than implicit](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/), mandating that service name sounds a good thing to do and a warning is now printed if you do not define your service name.

To remove the warning, embed the options into a `service` block:

```diff
apollo {
+ service("service") {
    packageName.set("com.example")
    // ...
+ }
}
```

# Version 3.7.0

_2022-11-08_

This version adds multiple new low level features. These new features expose a lot of API surface, and they will probably stay experimental until 4.0. Feedback is always very welcome.    

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new & experimental] compiler hooks API (#4474, #4026)

Compiler hooks allow you to tweak the generated models by exposing the underlying JavaPoet/KotlinPoet structures. You can use it for an example to:

- Add a 'null' default value to model arguments ([source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/blob/fb51dafaa4b02a55b6926546927d176078513543/tests/compiler-hooks/build.gradle.kts#L81))
- Introduce a common interface for all models that implement `__typename` ([source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/blob/fb51dafaa4b02a55b6926546927d176078513543/tests/compiler-hooks/build.gradle.kts#L136))
- Add a prefix to generated models ([source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/blob/fb51dafaa4b02a55b6926546927d176078513543/tests/compiler-hooks/build.gradle.kts#L185))
- Any other thing you can think of

To do so, make sure to use the "external" version of the plugin:

```kotlin
plugins {
  // Note: using the external plugin here to be able to reference KotlinPoet classes
  id("com.apollographql.apollo3.external")
}
```

And then register your hook to the plugin:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("defaultnullvalues") {
    packageName.set("hooks.defaultnullvalues")
    compilerKotlinHooks.set(listOf(DefaultNullValuesHooks()))
  }
}
```

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new & experimental] operationBasedWithInterfaces codegen (#4370)

By default, Apollo Kotlin models fragments with synthetic nullable fields. If you have a lot of fragments, checking these fields requires using `if` statements. For an example, with a query like so:

```graphql
{
  animal {
    species
    ... on WarmBlooded {
      temperature
    }
    ... on Pet {
      name
    }
    ... on Cat {
      mustaches
    }
  }
}
```

you can access data like so:

```kotlin
if (animal.onWarmBlooded != null) {
  // Cannot smart cast because of https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-8819/
  println(animal.onWarmBlooded!!.temperature)
}
if (animal.onPet != null) {
  println(animal.onPet!!.name) 
}
if (animal.onCat != null) {
  println(animal.onCat!!.mustaches)
}
```

Some of the combinations could be impossible. Maybe all the pets in your schema are warm blooded. Or maybe only cat is a warm blooded. To model this better and work around [KT-8819](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-8819), @chalermpong implemented a new codegen that adds a base sealed interface. Different implementations contain the same synthetic fragment fields as in the default codegen except that their nullability will be updated depending the branch:

```kotlin
when (animal) {
  is WarmBloodedPetAnimal -> {
    println(animal.onWarmBlooded!!.temperature)
    println(animal.onPet!!.name)
  }
  is PetAnimal -> {
    // Some pet that is not warm blooded, e.g. a Turtle maybe?
    println(animal.onPet!!.name)
  }
  is OtherAnimal -> {
    println(animal.species)
  }
  // Note how there is no branch for Cat because it's a WarmBloodedPetAnimal
  // Also no branch for WarmBlooded animal because all pets in this (fictional) sample schema are WarmBlooded. This could be different in another schema
}
```

To try it out, add this to your Gradle scripts:

```kotlin
apollo {
  codegenModels.set("experimental_operationBasedWithInterfaces") 
}
```

Many many thanks to @chalermpong for diving into this üíô

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new & experimental] usedCoordinates auto detection (#4494)

By default, Apollo Kotlin only generates the types that are used in your queries. This is important because some schemas are really big and generating all the types would waste a lot of CPU cycles. In multi-modules scenarios, the codegen only knows about types that are used locally in that module. If two sibling modules use the same type and that type is not used upstream, that could lead to errors like this:

```
duplicate Type '$Foo' generated in modules: feature1, feature2
Use 'alwaysGenerateTypesMatching' in a parent module to generate the type only once
```

This version introduces new options to detect the used types automatically. It does so by doing a first pass at the GraphQL queries to determine the used type. Upstream modules can use the results of that computation without creating a circular dependency. To set up auto detection of used coordinates, configure your schema module to get the used coordinates from the feature module using the `apolloUsedCoordinates` configuration:

```kotlin
// schema/build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime")
  // Get the used coordinates from your feature module
  apolloUsedCoordinates(project(":feature"))
  // If you have several, add several dependencies
  apolloUsedCoordinates(project(":feature-2"))
}

apollo {
  service("my-api") {
    packageName.set("com.example.schema")
    generateApolloMetadata.set(true)
  }
}
```

And in each of your feature module, configure the `apolloSchema` dependency:

```kotlin
// feature/build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime")
  // Depend on the codegen from the schema
  apolloMetadata(project(":schema"))
  // But also from the schema so as not to create a circular dependency
  apolloSchema(project(":schema"))
}

apollo {
  // The service names must match
  service("my-api") {
    packageName.set("com.example.feature")
  }
}
```

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Kotlin 1.7 (#4314)

Starting with this release, Apollo Kotlin is built with Kotlin 1.7.10. This doesn't impact Android and JVM projects (the minimum supported version of Kotlin continues to be 1.5) but if you are on a project using Native or JS, you will need to update the Kotlin version to 1.7.0+.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `@defer` support

`@defer` support is experimental in the Kotlin Client and currently a [Stage 2 GraphQL specification draft](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#stage-2-draft) to allow incremental delivery of response payloads. 

`@defer` allows you to specify a fragment as deferrable, meaning it can be omitted in the initial response and delivered as a subsequent payload. This improves latency for all fields that are not in that fragment. You can read more about `@defer` in the [RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md) and contribute/ask question in the [`@defer` working group](https://github.com/robrichard/defer-stream-wg).

Apollo Kotlin supports `@defer` by default and will deliver the successive payloads as `Flow` items. Given the below query:

```graphql
query GetComputer {
  computer {
    __typename
    id
    ...ComputerFields @defer
  }
}

fragment ComputerFields on Computer {
  cpu
  year
  screen {
    resolution
  }
}
```

And the following server payloads:

**payload 1**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "computer": {
      "__typename": "Computer",
      "id": "Computer1"
    }
  },
  "hasNext": true
}
```

**payload 2**:
```json
{
  "incremental": [
    {
      "data": {
        "cpu": "386",
        "year": 1993,
        "screen": {
          "resolution": "640x480"
        }
      },
      "path": [
        "computer",
      ]
    }
  ],
  "hasNext": true
}
```

You can listen to payloads by using `toFlow()`:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(query).toFlow().collectIndexed { index, response ->
  // This will be called twice

  if (index == 0) {
    // First time without the fragment
    assertNull(response.data?.computer?.computerFields)
  } else if (index == 1) {
    // Second time with the fragment
    assertNotNull(response.data?.computer?.computerFields)
  }
}
```

You can read more about it in [the documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/fetching/defer).

As always, feedback is very welcome. Let us know what you think of the feature by
either [opening an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues)
, [joining the community](http://community.apollographql.com/new-topic?category=Help&tags=mobile,client)

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Data Builders (#4321)

Apollo Kotlin 3.0 introduced [test builders](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/testing/test-builders/). While they are working, they have several limitations. The main one was that being [response based](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/response-based-codegen#the-responsebased-codegen), they could generate a lot of code. Also, they required passing custom scalars using their Json encoding, which is cumbersome. 

The [data builders](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/testing/data-builders/) are a simpler version of the test builders that generate builders based on schema types. This means most of the generated code is shared between all your implementations except for a top level `Data {}` function in each of your operation:

```kotlin
// Replace
val data = GetHeroQuery.Data {
  hero = humanHero {
    name = "Luke"
  }
} 

// With
val data = GetHeroQuery.Data {
  hero = buildHuman {
    name = "Luke"
  }
} 
```

# Version 3.5.0 

_2022-08-01_

With this release, Apollo Kotlin now uses Kotlin Native's new memory model. It also contains a number of other improvements and bug fixes. 

## üíôÔ∏è External contributors

Many thanks to `@glureau` for carefully adding new watch targets ‚åöüíô.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Kotlin Native: new memory manager (#4287)

Apollo Kotlin is now requiring applications to use the [new memory manager, a.k.a. new memory model](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/08/try-the-new-kotlin-native-memory-manager-development-preview/). Thanks to this change, the restriction that operations had to be executed from the main thread on Apple targets is now removed. You can also use [kotlinx.coroutines.test.runTest](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-test/kotlinx.coroutines.test/run-test.html). Last but not least, benchmarks seem to [indicate](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/4287/files?w=1#diff-aead75359419ef1647be74310bd7093e4cc2d9393917d17029d5fcc5e11ce1ef) that performance is better under the new memory manager!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `@targetName` directive (#4243)

This directive was introduced in v3.3.1 to allow overriding the name of enum values in the generated code. It has now been extended to allow configuring the generated name of Interfaces, Enums, Unions, Scalars and Input objects. This can be used to make the generated code nicer to use, or to avoid name clashes with Kotlin types (e.g. `Long`) in Kotlin Native.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Automatic resolution of Apollo artifacts versions from the plugin version (#4279)

From now on, you no longer need to specify explicitly the versions of Apollo dependencies: if omitted, the same version as the Apollo Gradle plugin will be used. This should facilitate upgrades and avoid potential mistakes:

```kotlin
plugins {
  plugins {
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm") version "1.7.10"
    id("com.apollographql.apollo3") version "3.5.0"
  }

  dependencies {
    // Replace this
    // implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime:3.5.0")
    
    // with
    implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime")
  }
}

```

## üöß [deprecated] `runTest` (#4292)

With the new memory model, Apollo's specific `runTest` method from `apollo-testing-support` is no longer useful and has been deprecated. If you were using it, you should now be able to use [Kotlin's `runTest`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/kotlinx-coroutines-test/README.md) instead, or simply `runBlocking`.


## üöß [breaking] Automatic detection of `type` enum values.

If you have an enum with a `type` value, this value used to name clash with the generated `type` property. This version now detects this case automatically and escapes `type` to `type_`. If you had previously used `@targetName` to workaround this issue, you can now remove it to avoid it being escaped twice:

```graphql 
# Remove this
extend enum SomeEnum {
  type @targetName(name: "type_")
}
```

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

- Support watchosArm32 (#4260)
- Support @targetName on Interfaces, Enums, Unions, Scalars and Input objects (#4243)
- üêò  support lazy APIs for newer AGP versions (#4264)
- Pagination: add connectionFields argument to @typePolicy (#4265)
- üêò Get the dependencies version from the plugin automagically (#4279)
- Automatically escape `type` in enum values (#4295)
- Fix inferred variables in both nullable and non-nullable locations (#4306)
- Native: assume New Memory Manager (#4287)

# Version 3.4.0

_2022-07-11_

This release contains a few important bug fixes (#4214, #4224, #4247, #4256), makes it possible to compile with Gradle
7.4 and `apollo-gradle-plugin` (#4218).

It also introduces `-incubating` cache artifacts.

## üíôÔ∏è External contributors

Many thanks to @ArjanSM, @zebehringer, @mm-kk-experiments, @mune0903, @stengvac, @elenigen, @shamsidinb,
@StylianosGakis for the awesome contributions üòÉ!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `-incubating` cache artifacts.

This version introduces the below artifacts:

- `apollo-normalized-cache-incubating`
- `apollo-normalized-cache-api-incubating`
- `apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite-incubating`

These artifacts introduce new APIs to work with cache expiration and pagination (as well
as [other cache improvements](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/2331) in the future).

These artifacts have no backward compatibility guarantees and most likely have worse performance than the non-incubating
artifacts. Documentation will be added once the API stabilize. In the short term, the best place to look for examples
are the integration tests:

- [Expiration tests](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/blob/363c73d89f1f0bbe773e98fbfac873c8b93b666d/tests/sqlite/src/commonTest/kotlin/ExpirationTest.kt)
- [Pagination tests](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/tree/d5b4fc3f12087e8a3585cd63531ccc590dee3098/tests/pagination/src/commonTest/kotlin)

_Note_: The experimental `withDates: Boolean` argument was introduced in 3.3.1 in the regular artifacts and is removed
as part of this release. Use the `-incubating` artifacts to use it.

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

- add TrimmableNormalizedCacheFactory (#4239)
- üöß remove withDates (#4257)
- üóÑÔ∏è Chunk parameters in large responses (#4256)
- Fix for improper handling of JsonNumber in BufferedSinkJsonWriter (#4247)
- Incubating modules for the next gen cache (#4241)
- Pagination: fixes in FieldRecordMerger and MemoryCache (#4237)
- make it possible to reuse a File Upload (#4228)
- Persist Record arguments/metadata with the SQL Json backend (#4211)
- requestedDispatcher -> dispatcher (#4220)
- Fix test errors were emitted outside the Flow (#4224)
- Make it possible to compile with Kotlin 1.5 and apollo-gradle-plugin (#4218)
- üèñÔ∏è Relax MapJsonReader endObject, fixes reading inline + named fragments with compat models (#4214)
- Introduce RecordMerger (#4197)
- Add @typePolicy(embeddedFields: String! = "") (#4196)

# Version 3.3.2

_2022-06-17_

This is a hot fix release that fixes a crash that could happen in the codegen when using `responseBased` codegen in a
multimodule setup. It also includes a fix for incorrect generated code when using certain reserved names in enum values.

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

- Update to KotlinPoet `1.12.0`, fixes generating enum values whose name clashes with other symbols (#4034)
- Update to Ktor 2 (#4190)
- Fix NPE in checkCapitalizedFields (#4201)

# Version 3.3.1

_2022-06-13_

This release introduces `@typePolicy` on interface/enums, improvements on subscription error handling, and on Test
Builders. It also contains a number of other improvements and bug fixes!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `@typePolicy` on interfaces and unions (#4131)

[The `@typePolicy` directive](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/caching/declarative-ids#typepolicy) can now be
declared on interfaces and unions. Thank you @bubba for the contribution!

## üîå WebSockets / Subscriptions error handling (#4147)

An issue where `websocketReopenWhen` was not called in some cases was fixed. Also, this release
introduces `SubscriptionOperationException`. A `SubscriptionOperationException` will be thrown instead of the more
generic `ApolloNetworkError` if a subscription fails due to a specific operation error.

## üìê Test Builders improvements and fixes

* A DslMarker was added to improve usage with nested builders (#4089)
* When calling a builder, but not assigning it to a field, an error is now thrown, preventing mistakes (#4122)
* The error message displayed when `__typename` is missing was made clearer (#4146)
* Fix: use `rawValue` instead of `name` for enums (#4121)

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] ApolloClient implements Closable (#4142)

`ApolloClient` now implements `okio.Closable` so you can
use [`use`](https://square.github.io/okio/3.x/okio/okio/okio/use.html) with it. Thanks @yogurtearl for this
contribution!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] experimental `@targetName` directive on enum values (#4144)

If an enum value name is clashing with a reserved name (e.g. `type`) you can now use this directive to instruct the
codeGen to use the specified name for the value instead. This directive is experimental for now.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] experimental support for renaming directives (#4174)

As we add more client directives, the risk of nameclash with existing schema directives increases. If this happens, you
can now import Apollo client directives using `@link`:

```graphql
# extra.graphqls
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/kotlin_labs/v0.1") 
```

This adds a `@kotlin_labs__` prefix to all Apollo client directives:

```graphql
{
  hero {
    name @kotlin_labs__nonnull
  }
}
```

## ü§ñ `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory` initialization on Android (#4104)

It is no longer necessary to pass a `Context` when initializing the `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory` on Android. A `Context`
is automatically provided, via [App Startup](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/app-startup).

```kotlin
// Before
val sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory(context, "apollo.db")

// After
val sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory("apollo.db")
```

## üìù [new] Public API tracking

This release starts tracking the public API of all modules, including MockServer. Even if the API remains experimental,
we'll try to keep the number of breaking changes low in the future.

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

- üêò publish `apollo-gradle-plugin-external` (#4078)

# Version 3.3.0

_2022-05-04_

This is the first release with [HMPP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-hierarchy.html) support. If you're using
multiplatform, updating to Kotlin 1.6.21 is strongly encouraged.

This release also brings WebSocket related improvements and other fixes!

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Hierarchical MultiPlatform Project (HMPP) (#4033)

When using Apollo Kotlin on a multiplatform project, this release is compatible with
the [hierarchical project structure](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-hierarchy.html), which makes it easier to
share common code among several targets. Using HMPP in your project also fixes some issues when compiling Kotlin
metadata. See https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/4019
and https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-51970/ for more details.

**‚úã Note**: If you're using multiplatform, we strongly encourage updating to Kotlin 1.6.21. If that is not an option,
you might have issues resolving dependencies. More infos
in [this issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/4095#issuecomment-1123571706).

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `WebSocketNetworkTransport.closeConnection` (#4049)

This new method can be used in conjunction
with [`reopenWhen`](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-kotlin/kdoc/apollo-runtime/com.apollographql.apollo3/-apollo-client/-builder/web-socket-reopen-when.html)
to force a reconnection to the server. This could be useful for instance when needing to pass new auth tokens in the
headers. If you were using `subscriptionManager.reconnect()` in 2.x, `closeConnection` is a simple way to achieve the
same behaviour.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `GraphQLWsProtocol.connectionPayload` is now a lambda (#4043)

With `GraphQLWsProtocol`, if you need to pass parameters to the connection payload, previously you would pass them as a
static map to the builder. With this change you can now pass a lambda providing them as needed. This facilitates passing
fresh auth tokens when connecting.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Add insecure option to download schema (#4021)

You can now use the `--insecure` flag when downloading a schema
with [`downloadApolloSchema`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/plugin-configuration/#downloading-a-schema)
, to bypass the certificate check, which can be useful if a server is configured with a self-signed certificate for
instance.

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

- Add WebSocketNetworkTransport.closeConnection (#4049)
- Made connectionPayload as suspend function in GraphQLWsProtocol (#4043)
- ‚ö° Ignore unknown websocket messages (#4066)
- Kotlin 1.6.21 & HMPP (#4033)
- Provide a Content-Length when using Upload (#4056)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è add HttpRequest.newBuilder(url, method) (#4038)
- Escape enum constants (#4035)
- Fix the Moshi adapter used for OperationOutput. Moshi cannot get the type parameters from the typealias
  automagically (#4022)
- Add insecure option to download schema (#4021)
- Try to reduce allocations in MapJsonReader (#3935)
- üîí Deprecate BearerTokenInterceptor and provide tests and docs instead (#4068)

## ‚ù§Ô∏è External contributors

Many thanks to @CureleaAndrei and @kdk96 for contributing to this release! üôè

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deprecations

- `BearerTokenInterceptor` was provided as an example but is too simple for most use cases, and has therefore been
  deprecated
  in this release. [This page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/authentication) provides more details
  about authentication.
- The previous ways of passing parameters to the connection payload with `GraphQLWsProtocol` has been deprecated (see
  above).

# Version 3.2.2

_2022-04-11_

A maintenance release to fix the `addJvmOverloads` option added in 3.2.0 as well as other fixes. If you're using APQs,
the mutations are now always send using `POST`.
See [#4006](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/4006#issuecomment-1092628783) for details and a way to
override the behaviour if you really need to.

Many thanks to @benedict-lim, @olivierg13, @konomae and @sproctor for their contributions üíô

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

* Use a constant for JvmOverloads to avoid a crash due to relocation (#4008)
* Always use POST for Mutations in APQs (Auto Persisted Queries) (#4011)
* Add configurable headers to WebSocketNetworkTransport (#3995)
* Handle SqlNormalizedCache merge APIs Exceptions with ApolloExceptionHandler (#4002)
* Add adapter for java.time.OffsetDateTime (#4007)
* ‚è∞ Add tests for date adapters (#3999)
* Fix wrong LocalDate and LocalDateTime formats in JavaTimeAdapters (#3997)

# Version 3.2.1

_2022-04-05_

This release introduces a few improvements and bug fixes.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `ApolloCall<D>.emitCacheMisses(Boolean)` (#3980)

When observing the cache with `watch`, the behavior was to not emit cache misses at all, which may not desirable in
certain cases. With this new option, you can now choose to emit them: in that case responses will be emitted with a
null `data`.

This can be used like so:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(query)
    .fetchPolicy(FetchPolicy.CacheOnly)
    .emitCacheMisses(true)
    .watch()
    .collect { response ->
      // response.data will be null in case of cache misses
    }
```

This is also closer to the behavior that was in place in v2. Many thanks to @mateuszkwiecinski for the insights and
raising the issue!

## ‚öôÔ∏è [breaking] Allow configuration of frame types used in `SubscriptionWsProtocol` and default to Text (#3992)

When using subscriptions over WebSockets with `SubscriptionWsProtocol` (the default), the frames were sent in the binary
format. It was reported that this was not compatible with certain servers ([DGS](https://netflix.github.io/dgs)
, [graphql-java-kickstart](https://github.com/graphql-java-kickstart/graphql-spring-boot)) that are expecting text
frames. This is now fixed and the default is to send text frames.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This may be a breaking change if your server expects binary frames only!

If that is the case, you can use the new `frameType` option to configure the frame type to be sent:

```kotlin
client = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .webSocketServerUrl("wss://...")
    .wsProtocol(GraphQLWsProtocol.Factory(frameType = WsFrameType.Binary))
    .build()
```

Many thanks to @Krillsson and @aviewfromspace1 for the insights and raising the issue!

## üë∑‚Äç All changes

* Allow configuration of frame types used in SubscriptionWsProtocol and default to Text (#3992)

# Version 3.2.0

_2022-03-29_

üíô Thanks to @undermark5, @demoritas, @rkoron007, @akshay253101, @StylianosGakis, @Goooler, @jeffreydecker, @theBradfo,
@anderssandven and @olivierg13 for contributing to this release.

This version adds JS WebSocket support, more options to deal with `__typename` amongst other features and bugfixes.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] JS WebSocket support (#3913)

Version 3.2.0 now has WebSocket support for Javascript targets courtesy of @undermark5! This is a huge milestone and
means the JS target is now even closer to its JVM and iOS counterparts.

|  | `jvm` | Apple | `js` | `linuxX64`
| --- | :---: |:-----:|:----:| :---: |

| `apollo-http-cache` |‚úÖ|  üö´   |  üö´  |üö´|

The implementation is based on the [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library on Node and
the [`WebSocket` API](https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org//) on the browser and inspired by [Ktor](https://ktor.io/).

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Fine grained `__typename` control (#3939)

This version generates non-nullable fragments when it knows the fragment is always present:

```graphql
{
  cat {
    # Because Animal is a supertype of Cat this condition will always be true
    ... on Animal {
      species
    }
  }
}
```

In addition, it introduces a `addTypename` Gradle option to have better control over when to add the `__typename` field:

```kotlin
/**
 * When to add __typename. One of "always", "ifFragments", "ifAbstract" or "ifPolymorphic"
 *
 * - "always": Add '__typename' for every compound field
 *
 * - "ifFragments": Add '__typename' for every selection set that contains fragments (inline or named)
 * This is adding a lot more '__typename' than the other solutions and will be certainly removed in
 * a future version. If you require '__typename' explicitly, you can add it to your queries.
 * This causes cache misses when introducing fragments where no fragment was present before and will be certainly removed in
 * a future version.
 *
 * - "ifAbstract": Add '__typename' for abstract fields, i.e. fields that are of union or interface type
 * Note: It also adds '__typename' on fragment definitions that satisfy the same property because fragments
 * could be read from the cache and we don't have a containing field in that case.
 *
 * - "ifPolymorphic": Add '__typename' for polymorphic fields, i.e. fields that contains a subfragment
 * (inline or named) whose type condition isn't a super type of the field type.
 * If a field is monomorphic, no '__typename' will be added.
 * This adds the bare minimum amount of __typename but the logic is substantially more complex and
 * it could cause cache misses when using fragments on monomorphic fields because __typename can be
 * required in some cases.
 *
 * Note: It also adds '__typename' on fragment definitions that satisfy the same property because fragments
 * could be read from the cache and we don't have a containing field in that case.
 *
 * Default value: "ifFragments"
 */
```

document.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] Maven publishing for multi-module apollo metadata (#3904)

The Apollo Gradle plugin now creates a new "apollo" publication if `maven-publish` is found. This means you can now
publish the Apollo metadata to a maven repository:

```bash
# In your producer project
./gradlew publishApolloPublicationTo[SomeRepository]
``` 

Assuming your producer project is using `com.example:project:version` for maven coordinates, the Apollo metadata will be
published at `com.example:project-apollo:version`:

```kotlin
// In your consumer project
dependencies {
  implementation("com.example:project:version")
  apolloMetadata("com.example:project-apollo:version")
}
```

**Note**: There are absolutely no forward/backward compatibility guarantees for Apollo metadata yet. The Apollo version
used in the consumer **must** be the same as the one used in the producer.

## ‚ú®Ô∏è [new] `addJvmOverloads` Gradle option (#3907)

For better Java interop, you can now opt-in `addJvmOverloads`. `addJvmOverloads` will add the `@JvmOverloads` to your
Kotlin operations:

```kotlin
@JvmOverloads
class GetHeroQuery(val id: String, val episode: Optional<Episode> = Optional.Absent) {
  // ...
}
```

Meaning you can now create a new query from Java without having to specify `episode`: `new GetHeroQuery("1002")`

# Version 3.1.0

_2022-02-07_

Version 3.1.0 introduces new APIs for testing, mapping scalars as well a redesigned cache pipeline.
It also contains bugfixes around the `@include` directives, MemoryCache and GraphQL validation amongst other changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è [breaking] Fragment package name and `useSchemaPackageNameForFragments` (#3775)

If you're using `packageNamesFromFilePaths()`, the package name of generated fragment classes has changed.

Different generated types have different package names:

* Generated types coming from operations are generated based on the operation path
* Generated types coming from the schema (input objects, custom scalars and enums) are generated based on the schema
  path

Previously, fragments were using the schema path which is inconsistent because fragments are not defined in the schema
but are executable files, like operations.

Version 3.1.0 now uses the same logic for fragments as for operations. To revert to the previous behaviour, you can
use `useSchemaPackageNameForFragments`:

```kotlin
apollo {
  useSchemaPackageNameForFragments.set(true)
}
```

This is also done automatically if you're using `useVersion2Compat()`. Moving forward, the plan is to
remove `useSchemaPackageNameForFragments` in favor of setting a custom `PackageNameGenerator`. If you have use cases
that require `useSchemaPackageNameForFragments`,
please [reach out](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Aquestion%3A+Type%3A+Question&template=question.md&title=)
.

## ‚ú® [New] `QueueTestNetworkTransport` (#3757)

3.1.0 introduces `QueueTestNetworkTransport` to test at the GraphQL layer without needing to run an HTTP server.

To use it, configure your `ApolloClient`:

```kotlin
// This uses a QueueTestNetworkTransport that will play the queued responses
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .networkTransport(QueueTestNetworkTransport())
    .build()
```

You can then use the `enqueueTestResponse` extension function to specify the GraphQL responses to return:

```kotlin
val testQuery = GetHeroQuery("001")
val testData = GetHeroQuery.Data {
  hero = droidHero {
    name = "R2D2"
  }
}
apolloClient.enqueueTestResponse(testQuery, testData)
val actual = apolloClient.query(testQuery).execute().data!!
assertEquals(testData.hero.name, actual.hero.name)
```

## ‚ú® [New] `MockServerHandler` (#3757)

If you're testing at the HTTP layer, you can now define your own `MockServerHandler` to customize how the server is
going to answer to requests:

```kotlin
val customHandler = object : MockServerHandler {
  override fun handle(request: MockRequest): MockResponse {
    return if (/* Your custom logic here */) {
      MockResponse(
          body = """{"data": {"random": 42}}""",
          headers = mapOf("X-Test" to "true"),
      )
    } else {
      MockResponse(
          body = "Internal server error",
          statusCode = 500,
      )
    }
  }
}
val mockServer = MockServer(customHandler)
```

## ‚ú® [New] `FetchPolicy.CacheAndNetwork` (#3828)

Previously, `FetchPolicy`s were limited to policies that emitted at most **one** response. There was
a `executeCacheAndNetwork()` method but it felt asymmetrical. This version introduces `FetchPolicy.CacheAndNetwork` that
can emit up to two responses:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(query)
    // Check the cache and also use the network (1 or 2 values can be emitted)
    .fetchPolicy(FetchPolicy.CacheAndNetwork)
    // Execute the query and collect the responses
    .toFlow().collect { response ->
      // ...
    }
```

## ‚ú® [New] `ApolloCall<D>.fetchPolicyInterceptor(interceptor: ApolloInterceptor)` (#3743)

If you need more customized ways to fetch data from the cache or more fine-grained error handling that does not come
with the built-in `FetchPolicy`, you can now use `fetchPolicyInterceptor`:

```kotlin
// An, interceptor that will only use the network after getting a successful response
val refetchPolicyInterceptor = object : ApolloInterceptor {
  var hasSeenValidResponse: Boolean = false
  override fun <D : Operation.Data> intercept(
      request: ApolloRequest<D>,
      chain: ApolloInterceptorChain
  ): Flow<ApolloResponse<D>> {
    return if (!hasSeenValidResponse) {
      CacheOnlyInterceptor.intercept(request, chain).onEach {
        if (it.data != null) {
          // We have valid data, we can now use the network
          hasSeenValidResponse = true
        }
      }
    } else {
      // If for some reason we have a cache miss, get fresh data from the network
      CacheFirstInterceptor.intercept(request, chain)
    }
  }
}

apolloClient.query(myQuery)
    .refetchPolicyInterceptor(cacheOnlyInterceptor)
    .watch()
    .collect {
      //
    }
```

## ‚ú® [New] `Service.mapScalar` Gradle API (#3779)

You can now use `mapScalar` to specify your scalar mappings:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // Replace 
  customScalarsMapping.set(mapOf(
      "Date" to "java.util.Date"
  ))

  // With
  mapScalar("Date", "java.util.Date")
}
```

`mapScalar` also works with built-in scalar types so you can map the `ID` type to a kotlin Long:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // This requires registering an adapter at runtime with `addCustomScalarAdapter()` 
  mapScalar("ID", "kotlin.Long")
}
```

As an optimization, you can also provide the adapter at compile time. This will avoid a lookup at runtime everytime such
a scalar is read:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // No need to call `addCustomScalarAdapter()`, the generated code will use the provided adapter 
  mapScalar("ID", "kotlin.Long", "com.apollographql.apollo3.api.LongAdapter")
}
```

For convenience, a helper function is provided for common types:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // The generated code will use `kotlin.Long` and the builtin LongAdapter 
  mapScalarToKotlinLong("ID")

  // The generated code will use `kotlin.String` and the builtin StringAdapter
  mapScalarToKotlinString("Date")

  // The generated code will use `com.apollographql.apollo3.api.Upload` and the builtin UploadAdapter
  mapScalarToUpload("Upload")
}
```

## üöß [Changed] `convertApolloSchema` and `downloadApolloSchema` now use paths relative to the root of the project (#3773, #3752)

Apollo Kotlin adds two tasks to help to manage schemas: `convertApolloSchema` and `downloadApolloSchema`. These tasks
are meant to be used from the commandline.

Previously, paths were interpreted using the current working directory with `File(path)`. Unfortunately, this is
unreliable because Gradle might change the current working directory in some conditions (
see [Gradle#13927](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/13927)
or [Gradle#6074](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/6074) for an example).

With 3.1.0 and onwards, paths, will be interpreted relative to the root project
directory (`project.rootProject.file(path)`):

```
# schema is now interpreted relative to the root project directory and
# not the current working directory anymore. This example assumes there 
# is a 'app' module that applies the apollo plugin
./gradlew downloadApolloSchema \
  --endpoint="https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint" \
  --schema="app/src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls"
```

### Changes compared to `3.0.0-rc03`:

* Fix rewinding the Json stream when lists are involved (#3727)
* Kotlin 1.6.10 (#3723)
* Disable key fields check if unnecessary and optimize its perf (#3720)
* Added an easy way to log cache misses (#3724)
* Add a Data.toJson that uses reflection to lookup the adapter (#3719)
* Do not run the cache on the main thread (#3718)
* Promote JsonWriter extensions to public API (#3715)
* Make customScalarAdapters and subscriptionsNetworkTransport public (#3714)

# Version 3.0.0-rc03

_2021-12-13_

Compared to the previous RC, this version adds a few new convenience API and fixes 3 annoying issues.

üíô Many thanks to @ mateuszkwiecinski, @ schoeda and @ fn-jt for all the feedback üíô

## ‚ú® New APIs

- Make `ApolloCall.operation` public (#3698)
- Add `SubscriptionWsProtocolAdapter` (#3697)
- Add `Operation.composeJsonRequest` (#3697)

## ü™≤ Bug fixes

- Allow repeated `@fieldPolicy` (#3686)
- Fix incorrect merging of nested objects in JSON (#3672)
- Fix duplicate query detection (#3699)

# Version 3.0.0-rc02

_2021-12-10_

üíô Many thanks to @michgauz, @joeldenke, @rohandhruva, @schoeda, @CoreFloDev and @sproctor for all the feedback üíô

### ‚öôÔ∏è [breaking] Merge ApolloQueryCall, ApolloSubscriptionCall, ApolloMutationCall (#3676)

In order to simplify the API and keep the symmetry with `ApolloRequest<D>` and `ApolloResponse<D>`
, `ApolloQueryCall<D, E>`, `ApolloSubscriptionCall<D, E>`, `ApolloMutationCall<D, E>` are replaced with `ApolloCall<D>`.
This change should be mostly transparent but it's technically a breaking change. If you are
passing `ApolloQueryCall<D, E>` variables, it is safe to drop the second type parameter and use `ApolloCall<D>` instead.

### ‚ú® [New] Add `WebSocketNetworkTransport.reconnectWhen {}` (#3674)

You now have the option to reconnect a WebSocket automatically when an error happens and re-subscribe automatically
after the reconnection has happened. To do so, use the `webSocketReconnectWhen` parameter:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .httpServerUrl("http://localhost:8080/graphql")
    .webSocketServerUrl("http://localhost:8080/subscriptions")
    .wsProtocol(
        SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory(
            connectionPayload = {
              mapOf("token" to upToDateToken)
            }
        )
    )
    .webSocketReconnectWhen {
      // this is called when an error happens on the WebSocket
      it is ApolloWebSocketClosedException && it.code == 1001
    }
    .build()
```

### Better Http Batching API (#3670)

The `HttpBatchingEngine` has been moved to an `HttpInterceptor`. You can now configure Http batching with a specific
method:

```kotlin
apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl(mockServer.url())
    .httpBatching(batchIntervalMillis = 10)
    .build()
```

### All changes:

* Add 2.x symbols (`Rx2Apollo`, `prefetch()`, `customAttributes()`, `ApolloIdlingResource.create()`) to help the
  transition (#3679)
* Add canBeBatched var to ExecutionOptions (#3677)
* Merge ApolloQueryCall, ApolloSubscriptionCall, ApolloMutationCall (#3676)
* Add `WebSocketNetworkTransport.reconnectWhen {}` (#3674)
* Move BatchingHttpEngine to a HttpInterceptor (#3670)
* Add exposeErrorBody (#3661)
* fix the name of the downloadServiceApolloSchemaFromRegistry task (#3669)
* Fix DiskLruHttpCache concurrency (#3667)

# Version 3.0.0-rc01

_2021-12-07_

This version is the release candidate for Apollo Android 3 üöÄ. Please try it
and [report any issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/new/choose), we'll fix them urgently.

There is [documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/) and
a [migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/migration/3.0/). More details are coming soon. In a
nutshell, Apollo Android 3 brings, amongst other things:

* [coroutine APIs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/essentials/queries/) for easier concurrency
* [multiplatform support](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/kotlin-native/) makes it possible to run
  the same code on Android, JS, iOS, MacOS and linux
* [responseBased codegen](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/response-based-codegen/) is a new optional
  codegen that models fragments as interfaces
* SQLite batching makes reading from the SQLite cache significantly faster
* [Test builders](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/test-builders/) offer a simple APIs to build fake
  models for your tests
* [The @typePolicy and @fieldPolicy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/caching/declarative-ids/) directives
  make it easier to define your cache ids at compile time
* [The @nonnull](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/nonnull/) directive catches null values at parsing
  time, so you don't have to deal with them in your UI code

Compared to `beta05`, this version changes the default value of `generateOptionalOperationVariables`, is compatible with
Gradle configuration cache and fixes a few other issues.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API changes

### Optional operation variables (#3648) (breaking)

The default value for the `generateOptionalOperationVariables` config is now `true`.

What this means:

- By default, operations with nullable variables will be generated with `Optional` parameters
- You will need to wrap your parameters at the call site

For instance:

```graphql
query GetTodos($first: Int, $offset: Int) {
  todos(first: $first, offset: $offset) {
    ...Todo
  }
}
```

```kotlin
// Before
val query = GetTodosQuery(100, null)

// After
val query = GetTodosQuery(Optional.Present(100), Optional.Absent)

```

- If you prefer, you can set `generateOptionalOperationVariables` to `false` to generate non-optional parameters
  globally
- This can also be controlled on individual variables with the `@optional` directive
- More information about this can be
  found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/operation-variables/)

We think this change will make more sense to the majority of users (and is consistent with Apollo Android v2's behavior)
even though it may be more verbose, which is why it is possible to change the behavior via
the `generateOptionalOperationVariables` config.

To keep the `beta05` behavior, set `generateOptionalOperationVariables` to false in your Gradle configuration:

```
apollo {
  generateOptionalOperationVariables.set(false)
}
```

### ApolloClient.Builder improvements (#3647)

You can now pass WebSocket related options to the `ApolloClient.Builder` directly (previously this would have been done
via `NetworkTransport`):

```kotlin
// Before
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    // (...)
    .subscriptionNetworkTransport(WebSocketNetworkTransport(
        serverUrl = "https://example.com/graphql",
        idleTimeoutMillis = 1000L,
        wsProtocol = SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory()
    ))
    .build()

// After
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    // (...)
    .wsProtocol(SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory())
    .webSocketIdleTimeoutMillis(1000L)
    .build()
```

### Upgrade to OkHttp 4 (#3653) (breaking)

This version upgrades OkHttp to `4.9.3` (from `3.12.11`). This means Apollo Android now requires Android `apiLevel` `21`
+. As OkHttp 3 enters end of life at the end of the year and the vast majority of devices now support `apiLevel` `21`,
we felt this was a reasonable upgrade.

## ü™≤ Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to restart a websocket after a network error (#3646)
- Fixed an issue where Android Java projects could not use the Apollo Gradle plugin (#3652)

## üë∑ All Changes

- Update a few dependencies (#3653)
- Fix Android Java projects (#3652)
- Expose more configuration options on ApolloClient.Builder (#3647)
- Fix restarting a websocket after a network error (#3646)
- Change optional default value (#3648)
- Fix configuration cache (#3645)
