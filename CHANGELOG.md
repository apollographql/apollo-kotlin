# Version 3.1.0

_2022-02-07_

Version 3.1.0 introduces new APIs for testing, mapping scalars as well a redesigned cache pipeline.
It also contains bugfixes around the `@include` directives, MemoryCache and GraphQL validation amongst other changes.

## ‚ú® [New] `QueueTestNetworkTransport` (#3757)

3.1.0 introduces `QueueTestNetworkTransport` to test at the GraphQL layer without needing to run an HTTP server.

To use it, configure your `ApolloClient`:

```kotlin
// This uses a QueueTestNetworkTransport that will play the queued responses
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .networkTransport(QueueTestNetworkTransport())
    .build()
```

You can then use the `enqueueTestResponse` extension function to specify the GraphQL responses to return:

```kotlin
val testQuery = GetHeroQuery("001")
val testData = GetHeroQuery.Data {
  hero = droidHero {
    name = "R2D2"
  }
}
apolloClient.enqueueTestResponse(testQuery, testData)
val actual = apolloClient.query(testQuery).execute().data!!
assertEquals(testData.hero.name, actual.hero.name)
```

## ‚ú® [New] `MockServerHandler` (#3757)

If you're testing at the HTTP layer, you can now define your own `MockServerHandler` to customize how the server is going to answer to requests:

```kotlin
val customHandler = object : MockServerHandler {
  override fun handle(request: MockRequest): MockResponse {
    return if (/* Your custom logic here */) {
      MockResponse(
          body = """{"data": {"random": 42}}""",
          headers = mapOf("X-Test" to "true"),
      )
    } else {
      MockResponse(
          body = "Internal server error",
          statusCode = 500,
      )
    }
  }
}
val mockServer = MockServer(customHandler)
```

## ‚ú® [New] `FetchPolicy.CacheAndNetwork` (#3828)

Previously, `FetchPolicy`s were limited to policies that emitted at most **one** response. There was a `executeCacheAndNetwork()` method but it felt asymmetrical. This version introduces `FetchPolicy.CacheAndNetwork` that can emit up to two responses:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(query)
  // Check the cache and also use the network (1 or 2 values can be emitted)
  .fetchPolicy(FetchPolicy.CacheAndNetwork)
  // Execute the query and collect the responses
  .toFlow().collect { response ->
      // ...
  }
```

## ‚ú® [New] `ApolloCall<D>.fetchPolicyInterceptor(interceptor: ApolloInterceptor)` (#3743)

If you need more customized ways to fetch data from the cache or more fine-grained error handling that does not come with the built-in `FetchPolicy`, you can now use `fetchPolicyInterceptor`:

```kotlin
// An, interceptor that will only use the network after getting a successful response
val refetchPolicyInterceptor = object : ApolloInterceptor {
  var hasSeenValidResponse: Boolean = false
  override fun <D : Operation.Data> intercept(request: ApolloRequest<D>, chain: ApolloInterceptorChain): Flow<ApolloResponse<D>> {
    return if (!hasSeenValidResponse) {
      CacheOnlyInterceptor.intercept(request, chain).onEach {
        if (it.data != null) {
          // We have valid data, we can now use the network
          hasSeenValidResponse = true
        }
      }
    } else {
      // If for some reason we have a cache miss, get fresh data from the network
      CacheFirstInterceptor.intercept(request, chain)
    }
  }
}

apolloClient.query(myQuery)
    .refetchPolicyInterceptor(cacheOnlyInterceptor)
    .watch()
    .collect {
      //
    }
```

## ‚ú® [New] `Service.mapScalar` Gradle API (#3779)

You can now use `mapScalar` to specify your scalar mappings:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // Replace 
  customScalarsMapping.set(mapOf(
      "Date" to "java.util.Date"
  ))
  
  // With
  mapScalar("Date", "java.util.Date")
}
```

`mapScalar` also works with built-in scalar types so you can map the `ID` type to a kotlin Long:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // This requires registering an adapter at runtime with `addCustomScalarAdapter()` 
  mapScalar("ID", "kotlin.Long")
}
```

As an optimization, you can also provide the adapter at compile time. This will avoid a lookup at runtime everytime such a scalar is read:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // No need to call `addCustomScalarAdapter()`, the generated code will use the provided adapter 
  mapScalar("ID", "kotlin.Long", "com.apollographql.apollo3.api.LongAdapter")
}
```

For convenience, a helper function is provided for common types:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // The generated code will use `kotlin.Long` and the builtin LongAdapter 
  mapScalarToKotlinLong("ID")

  // The generated code will use `kotlin.String` and the builtin StringAdapter
  mapScalarToKotlinString("Date")

  // The generated code will use `com.apollographql.apollo3.api.Upload` and the builtin UploadAdapter
  mapScalarToUpload("Upload")
}
```

## üöß [Changed] `convertApolloSchema` and `downloadApolloSchema` now use paths relative to the root of the project (#3773, #3752)

Apollo Kotlin adds two tasks to help to manage schemas: `convertApolloSchema` and `downloadApolloSchema`. These tasks are meant to be used from the commandline.

Previously, paths were interpreted using the current working directory with `File(path)`. Unfortunately, this is unreliable because Gradle might change the current working directory in some conditions (see [Gradle#13927](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/13927) or [Gradle#6074](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/6074) for an example).

With 3.1.0 and onwards, paths, will be interpreted relative to the root project directory (`project.rootProject.file(path)`):

```
# schema is now interpreted relative to the root project directory and
# not the current working directory anymore. This example assumes there 
# is a 'app' module that applies the apollo plugin
./gradlew downloadApolloSchema \
  --endpoint="https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint" \
  --schema="app/src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls"
```

# Version 3.0.0-rc03

_2021-12-13_

Compared to the previous RC, this version adds a few new convenience API and fixes 3 annoying issues.

üíô Many thanks to @ mateuszkwiecinski, @ schoeda and @ fn-jt for all the feedback üíô


## ‚ú® New APIs
- Make `ApolloCall.operation` public (#3698)
- Add `SubscriptionWsProtocolAdapter` (#3697)
- Add `Operation.composeJsonRequest` (#3697)

## ü™≤ Bug fixes

- Allow repeated `@fieldPolicy` (#3686)
- Fix incorrect merging of nested objects in JSON (#3672)
- Fix duplicate query detection (#3699)


# Version 3.0.0-rc02

_2021-12-10_

üíô Many thanks to @michgauz, @joeldenke, @rohandhruva, @schoeda, @CoreFloDev and @sproctor for all the feedback üíô  

### ‚öôÔ∏è [breaking] Merge ApolloQueryCall, ApolloSubscriptionCall, ApolloMutationCall (#3676)

In order to simplify the API and keep the symmetry with `ApolloRequest<D>` and `ApolloResponse<D>`, `ApolloQueryCall<D, E>`, `ApolloSubscriptionCall<D, E>`, `ApolloMutationCall<D, E>` are replaced with `ApolloCall<D>`. This change should be mostly transparent but it's technically a breaking change. If you are passing `ApolloQueryCall<D, E>` variables, it is safe to drop the second type parameter and use `ApolloCall<D>` instead.

### ‚ú® [New] Add `WebSocketNetworkTransport.reconnectWhen {}` (#3674)

You now have the option to reconnect a WebSocket automatically when an error happens and re-subscribe automatically after the reconnection has happened. To do so, use the `webSocketReconnectWhen` parameter: 

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .httpServerUrl("http://localhost:8080/graphql")
    .webSocketServerUrl("http://localhost:8080/subscriptions")
    .wsProtocol(
        SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory(
            connectionPayload = {
              mapOf("token" to upToDateToken)
            }
        )
    )
    .webSocketReconnectWhen {
      // this is called when an error happens on the WebSocket
      it is ApolloWebSocketClosedException && it.code == 1001
    }
    .build()
```

### Better Http Batching API (#3670)

The `HttpBatchingEngine` has been moved to an `HttpInterceptor`. You can now configure Http batching with a specific method:

```kotlin
apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl(mockServer.url())
    .httpBatching(batchIntervalMillis = 10)
    .build()
```

### All changes:

* Add 2.x symbols (`Rx2Apollo`, `prefetch()`, `customAttributes()`, `ApolloIdlingResource.create()`) to help the transition (#3679)
* Add canBeBatched var to ExecutionOptions (#3677)
* Merge ApolloQueryCall, ApolloSubscriptionCall, ApolloMutationCall (#3676)
* Add `WebSocketNetworkTransport.reconnectWhen {}` (#3674)
* Move BatchingHttpEngine to a HttpInterceptor (#3670)
* Add exposeErrorBody (#3661)
* fix the name of the downloadServiceApolloSchemaFromRegistry task (#3669)
* Fix DiskLruHttpCache concurrency (#3667)


# Version 3.0.0-rc01

* [The @nonnull](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/nonnull/) directive catches null values at parsing time, so you don't have to deal with them in your UI code


Compared to `beta05`, this version changes the default value of `generateOptionalOperationVariables`, is compatible with Gradle configuration cache and fixes a few other issues.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API changes

### Optional operation variables (#3648) (breaking)

The default value for the `generateOptionalOperationVariables` config is now `true`.

What this means:

- By default, operations with nullable variables will be generated with `Optional` parameters
- You will need to wrap your parameters at the call site

For instance:

```graphql
query GetTodos($first: Int, $offset: Int) {
  todos(first: $first, offset: $offset) {
    ...Todo
  }
}
```

```kotlin
// Before
val query = GetTodosQuery(100, null)

// After
val query = GetTodosQuery(Optional.Present(100), Optional.Absent)

```

- If you prefer, you can set `generateOptionalOperationVariables` to `false` to generate non-optional parameters globally
- This can also be controlled on individual variables with the `@optional` directive
- More information about this can be found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/advanced/operation-variables/)

We think this change will make more sense to the majority of users (and is consistent with Apollo Android v2's behavior) even though it may be more verbose, which is why it is possible to change the behavior via the `generateOptionalOperationVariables` config.

To keep the `beta05` behavior, set `generateOptionalOperationVariables` to false in your Gradle configuration:

```
apollo {
  generateOptionalOperationVariables.set(false)
}
```

### ApolloClient.Builder improvements (#3647)

You can now pass WebSocket related options to the `ApolloClient.Builder` directly (previously this would have been done via `NetworkTransport`):

```kotlin
// Before
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    // (...)
    .subscriptionNetworkTransport(WebSocketNetworkTransport(
        serverUrl = "https://example.com/graphql",
        idleTimeoutMillis = 1000L,
        wsProtocol = SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory()
    ))
    .build()

// After
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    // (...)
    .wsProtocol(SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory())
    .webSocketIdleTimeoutMillis(1000L)
    .build()
```

### Upgrade to OkHttp 4 (#3653) (breaking)

This version upgrades OkHttp to `4.9.3` (from `3.12.11`). This means Apollo Android now requires Android `apiLevel` `21`+. As OkHttp 3 enters end of life at the end of the year and the vast majority of devices now support `apiLevel` `21`, we felt this was a reasonable upgrade.

## ü™≤ Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where it was not possible to restart a websocket after a network error (#3646)
- Fixed an issue where Android Java projects could not use the Apollo Gradle plugin (#3652)


## üë∑ All Changes

- Update a few dependencies (#3653)
- Fix Android Java projects (#3652)
- Expose more configuration options on ApolloClient.Builder (#3647)
- Fix restarting a websocket after a network error (#3646)
- Change optional default value (#3648)
- Fix configuration cache (#3645)
