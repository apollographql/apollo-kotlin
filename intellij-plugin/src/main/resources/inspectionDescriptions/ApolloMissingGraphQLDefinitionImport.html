Reports usages of types and directives that are not imported or imported implicitly.
<p>
    Before being referenced, directives and types supported by Apollo Kotlin must be imported by your schema using the <code>@link</code> directive<br>.
    For instance, to use the <code>@semanticNonNull</code> directive, import it from the
    <a href="https://specs.apollo.dev/nullability/v0.4"><code>nullability</code></a> definitions:
<pre>
        extend schema
        @link(
          url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/nullability/v0.4",
          import: ["@semanticNonNull", "@catch", "@CatchTo", "@catchByDefault"]
        )
    </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Note: the <a href="https://specs.apollo.dev/kotlin_labs/v0.3"><code>kotlin_labs</code></a> directives such as <code>@typePolicy</code>
    are currently implicitly imported, so an explicit import is not required, but encouraged. This inspection will report
    their non-imported usage as a warning.
