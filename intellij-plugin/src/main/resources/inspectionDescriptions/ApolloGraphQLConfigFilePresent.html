Suggests to delete GraphQL config files on projects using Apollo Kotlin 4.
<p>
    It is no longer useful to have a GraphQL config file, as the Apollo plugin automatically provides the location of your
    project's operations and schema files to the GraphQL plugin, <br>
</p>
<p>
    Note: the Apollo plugin uses the Gradle tooling API to retrieve the project's GraphQL configuration.
