Reports Apollo services that don't configure a GraphQL endpoint.
<p>
    Configuring a service's GraphQL endpoint URL is recommended, as it enables the execution of queries directly from the IDE.<br>
    It also allows downloading the latest version of the schema easily, via a Gradle task or via the <kbd>Download Schema</kbd> action.<br>
