If you're looking for a specific feature (APQs, Codegen options, `@catch`, ...):
- check out the [apollo-kotlin-samples](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin-samples) repository for samples and recipes for advanced features
- the [integration-tests](../tests) have a lot of very focused examples of how to use Apollo Kotlin.
