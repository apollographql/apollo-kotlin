"""
Marks a field or variable definition as optional or required
By default Apollo Kotlin generates all variables of nullable types as optional, in compliance with the GraphQL specification,
but this can be configured with this directive, because if the variable was added in the first place, it's usually to pass a value

directive @optional(if: Boolean = true) on FIELD | VARIABLE_DEFINITION

"""
Marks a field as non-null. The corresponding Kotlin property will be made non-nullable even if the GraphQL type is nullable.
When used on an object definition in a schema document, `fields` must be non-empty and contain a selection set of fields that should be non-null
When used on a field from an executable document, `fields` must always be empty

Setting the directive at the schema level is usually easier as there is little reason that a field would be non-null in one place
and null in the other
