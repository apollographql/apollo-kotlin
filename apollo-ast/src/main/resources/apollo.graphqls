# The kotlin_labs directives
# You can import them with

# extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/kotlin_labs/v0.1", import: ["@optional", "@nonnull", "@typePolicy", "@fieldPolicy"])

# They are included unconditionally for historical reasons but this will change in a future version

# Marks a field or variable definition as optional or required
# By default Apollo Kotlin generates all variables of nullable types as optional, in compliance with the GraphQL specification,
# but this can be configured with this directive, because if the variable was added in the first place, it's usually to pass a value
directive @optional(if: Boolean = true) on FIELD | VARIABLE_DEFINITION

# Marks a field as non-null. The corresponding Kotlin property will be made non-nullable even if the GraphQL type is nullable.
# When used on an object definition in a schema document, `fields` must be non-empty and contain a selection set of fields that should be non-null
# When used on a field from an executable document, `fields` must always be empty
#
# Setting the directive at the schema level is usually easier as there is little reason that a field would be non-null in one place
# and null in the other
directive @nonnull(fields: String! = "") on OBJECT | FIELD

# Attach extra information to a given type
# `keyFields`: a selection set containing fields used to compute the cache key of an object. Order is important.
# `embeddedFields`: a selection set containing fields that shouldn't create a new cache Record and should be
# embedded in their parent instead. Order is unimportant.
directive @typePolicy(keyFields: String! = "", embeddedFields: String! = "") on OBJECT | INTERFACE | UNION

# Attach extra information to a given field
# `keyArgs`: a selection set used to compute a key from a field arguments. Composite args are not supported yet.
# `paginationArgs` (experimental): a selection set used to compute a pagination key from a field arguments.
