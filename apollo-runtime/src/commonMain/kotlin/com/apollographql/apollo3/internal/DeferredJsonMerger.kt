/**
 * Utility class for merging GraphQL JSON payloads received in multiple chunks when using the `@defer` directive.
 *
 * Each call to [merge] will merge the given chunk into the [merged] Map, and will also update the [mergedFragmentLabels] Set with the
 * value of its `label` field (if present).
 *
 * The fields in `data` are merged into the node found in [merged] at `path` (for the first call to [merge], the payload is
 * copied to [merged] as-is).
 *
 * `errors` and `extensions` fields are not merged: they are copied as-is (if present) to the [merged] Map at each call to [merge].
