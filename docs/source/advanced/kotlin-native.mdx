title: 'Kotlin native'
---

Apollo Kotlin is built for multiplatform and therefore supports iOS, MacOS, and other Darwin targets.

Because the current Kotlin memory model requires freezing objects that are accessed from multiple threads ([docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kmm-concurrency-overview.html)), there are some limitations.

In particular, you must create your `ApolloClient` and call `query` and other operations from the main thread. Apollo Kotlin then executes the work on a background thread and returns the result to the main thread.

## Multithreaded coroutines

By default when using the `x.y.z-native-mt` branch of coroutines, Gradle replaces the `-native-mt` version with the non-mt version as outlined [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/concurrency-and-coroutines.html#multithreaded-coroutines). To prevent this, add the following to your root `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
allprojects {
  configurations {
    all {
      resolutionStrategy {
        force("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:x.y.z-native-mt")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures that the same version is used everywhere, and that Gradle doesn't fail because `-native-mt` is a pre-release version [(`1.5.1-native-mt < 1.5.1`)](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_resolution.html#sub:resolution-strategy).
