title: 'Kotlin native'
---

Apollo Android is built for multiplatform and therefore supports iOS, MacOS and other Darwin targets.

Due to the fact that the current Kotlin memory model requires freezing objects that are accessed from multiple threads ([docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kmm-concurrency-overview.html), there are some limitations.

In particular, you must create your `ApolloClient` and call `query` and other operations from the main thread. Apollo Android will execute the work on a background thread and return the result to the main thread.

## Multithreaded coroutines
If using the x.y.z-native-mt branch of coroutines, gradle will replace the -native-mt version with the non-mt version as outlined [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/concurrency-and-coroutines.html#multithreaded-coroutines). To prevent this happening add the following to your root `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
allprojects {
    configurations {
        all {
            resolutionStrategy {
                force("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:x.y.z-native-mt")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This ensures that the same version is used everywhere and that Gradle doesn't fail because `-native-mt` is a pre-release version [(`1.5.1-native-mt < 1.5.1`)](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_resolution.html#sub:resolution-strategy)
