title: Kotlin native
---

Apollo Kotlin is built for multiplatform and therefore supports iOS, MacOS, and other Darwin targets.

Since version 3.5.0, the library requires executables to use the [new Kotlin Native Memory Manager](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/08/try-the-new-kotlin-native-memory-manager-development-preview/). To configure it on your project you can use the following snippet:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
kotlin.targets.withType(KotlinNativeTarget::class.java) {
    binaries.all {
        binaryOptions["memoryModel"] = "experimental"
    }
}
```

More information is available on the [migration guide](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/kotlin-native/NEW_MM.md#enable-the-new-mm).

## Multithreaded coroutines

By default when using the `x.y.z-native-mt` branch of coroutines, Gradle replaces the `-native-mt` version with the non-mt version as outlined [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/concurrency-and-coroutines.html#multithreaded-coroutines). To prevent this, add the following to your root `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
allprojects {
  configurations {
    all {
      resolutionStrategy {
        force("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:x.y.z-native-mt")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures that the same version is used everywhere, and that Gradle doesn't fail because `-native-mt` is a pre-release version [(`1.5.1-native-mt < 1.5.1`)](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_resolution.html#sub:resolution-strategy).
