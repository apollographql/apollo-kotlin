title: Apollo Kotlin galaxy 
---


The Apollo Kotlin galaxy is a collection of projects that are related to Apollo Kotlin but are loosely coupled. Their release schedule and maturity level varies.

They serve as a playground for new ideas (`apollo-kotlin-compose-support`, `apollo-kotlin-normalized-cache-incubating`) or helper projects providing additional functionality that is not core to Apollo Kotlin (`apollo-kotlin-mockserver`, `apollo-kotlin-cli`, `apollo-kotlin-execution`)

The Apollo Kotlin galaxy projects all start with `apollo-kotlin`:
