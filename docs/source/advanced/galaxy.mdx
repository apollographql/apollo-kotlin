title: Apollo Kotlin galaxy 
---


The Apollo Kotlin galaxy is a collection of projects that are related to Apollo Kotlin but are loosely coupled. Their release schedule and maturity level varies.

They serve as playground for new ideas (apollo-kotlin-compose-support, apollo-kotlin-normalized-cache-incubating) or as helper projects providing additional functionality that is not ready to be included in the main repository or has external dependencies (apollo-kotlin-mockserver, apollo-kotlin-adapters).

The Apollo Kotlin galaxy projects all start with `apollo-kotlin`:
