title: Experimental WebSockets

<ExperimentalFeature>

**The experimental WebSockets implementation are currently [experimental](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/release-stages/#experimental-features) in Apollo Kotlin.** If you have feedback on them, please let us know via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug&template=bug_report.md) or in the [Kotlin Slack community](https://slack.kotl.in/).

</ExperimentalFeature>

Historically, WebSockets have been one of the most complex and error-prone parts of Apollo Kotlin because:

1. The WebSocket transport protocol has no official specification and different implementations have different behaviours.
2. WebSockets are stateful and making them work using the old Kotlin native memory model was challenging.
3. Because WebSockets are long-lived connections, they are more exposed to errors and knowing when (or if) to retry is hard.
4. Not all subscriptions happen on WebSockets. Some use [HTTP multipart](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-multipart-protocol/) for an example.

Starting with 4.0.0, Apollo Kotlin provides a new `com.apollographql.apollo3.network.websocket` package containing new `WebSocketNetworkTransport` and `WebSocketEngine` implementations (instead of `com.apollographql.apollo3.network.ws` for the current implementations).

The `com.apollographql.apollo3.network.websocket` implementation provides the following:

1. Defaults to the [graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) protocol, which has become the de facto standard. Using the other protocols is still possible but having a main, specified, protocol ensures we can write a good and solid test suite.
2. Does not inherit from the old memory model design, making the code considerably simpler. In particular, `WebSocketEngine` is now event based and no attempt at flow control is done. If you buffers grow too much, your subscription fails.
3. Plays nicely with the ApolloClient `retryOnError` API.
4. Handles different Subscription transports more consistently.

## Status

While they are `@ApolloExperimental`, we believe the new `.websocket` APIS to be more robust than the non-experimental `.ws` ones. They are safe to use in non-lib use cases.

The "experimental" tag is to account for required API breaking changes based on community feedback. Ideally no change will be needed.

After a feedback phase, the current `.ws` APIs will become deprecated and the `.websocket` one promoted to stable by removing the `@ApolloExperimental` annotations. 

## Migration guide

In simple cases where you did not configure the underlying `WsProtocol` or retry logic, the migration should be about replacing `com.apollographql.apollo3.network.ws` with `com.apollographql.apollo3.network.websocket` everywhere:

```kotlin
// Replace
import com.apollographql.apollo3.network.ws.WebSocketNetworkTransport
import com.apollographql.apollo3.network.ws.WebSocketEngine
// etc...

// With
import com.apollographql.apollo3.network.websocket.WebSocketNetworkTransport
import com.apollographql.apollo3.network.websocket.WebSocketEngine
// etc...
```

Because we can't remove the current APIs just yet, the `ApolloClient.Builder` shortcut APIs are still pointing to the `.ws` implementations. To use the newer `.websocket` implementation, pass a `websocket.WebSocketNetworkTransport` directly:

```kotlin
// Replace
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl(serverUrl)
    .webSocketServerUrl(webSocketServerUrl)
    .webSocketEngine(myWebSocketEngine)
    .webSocketIdleTimeoutMillis(10_000)
    .build()

// With
import com.apollographql.apollo3.network.websocket.*
    
// [...]

ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl(serverUrl)
    .subscriptionNetworkTransport(
        WebSocketNetworkTransport.Builder()
            .serverUrl(webSocketServerUrl)
            // If you didn't set a WsProtocol before, make sure to include this 
            .wsProtocol(SubscriptionWsProtocol())
            // If you were already using GraphQLWsProtocol, this is now the default
            //.wsProtocol(GraphQLWsProtocol())
            .webSocketEngine(myWebSocketEngine)
            .idleTimeoutMillis(10_000)
            .build()
    )
    .build()
```

To account for non-websocket transports, like [multipart subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-multipart-protocol/), the retry is now handled on the `ApolloClient` instead of the `NetworkTransport`.

```kotlin
// Replace
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .subscriptionNetworkTransport(
        WebSocketNetworkTransport.Builder()
            .serverUrl(url)
            .reopenWhen { _, _ ->
              delay(1000)
              true
            }
            .build()
    )

// With
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .subscriptionNetworkTransport(
        WebSocketNetworkTransport.Builder()
            .serverUrl(url)
            .build()
    )
    // Only retry subscriptions
    .retryOnError { it.operation is Subscription }
```

The above uses the default retry algorithm:

* Wait until the network is available if you configured a [NetworkMonitor](network-connectivity).
* Or use exponential backoff else.

To customize the retry logic more, use `addRetryOnErrorInterceptor`:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .subscriptionNetworkTransport(
        WebSocketNetworkTransport.Builder()
            .serverUrl(url)
            .build()
    )
    .addRetryOnErrorInterceptor { exception, attempt -> 
      // retry logic here
      
      // return true to retry or false to terminate the Flow
      true
    }
```
