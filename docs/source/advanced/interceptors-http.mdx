title: HTTP interceptors
---

Apollo Android supports multi platform `HttpInterceptor` very similar to `OkHttp` `Interceptors`. Use them to add authentication headers, log the network calls or anything else.

The interface is a single method. For an example, implementing an authentication interceptors can be done with:

```kotlin
class AuthorizationInterceptor(val token: String) : HttpInterceptor {
  override suspend fun intercept(request: HttpRequest,  chain: HttpInterceptorChain): HttpResponse {
    return chain.proceed(request.newBuilder().addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer $token").build())
  }
}
```

Then add the interceptor to your `HttpNetworkTransport`:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
    .addHttpInterceptor(AuthorizationInterceptor(token))
    .build()
```

By default, Apollo Android comes with `ClientAwarenessInterceptor` and `LoggingInterceptor`.

## Reusing OkHttp interceptors on JVM only projects

If your project is a JVM only project and you already have an `OkHttp` `Interceptor`, you can also reuse it:

```kotlin
val okHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(interceptor)
    .build()

val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
    .okHttpClient(okHttpClient)
    .build()
```
