<ExperimentalFeature>

**Nullability annotations are currently [experimental](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/product-launch-stages/#experimental-features) in Apollo Kotlin.** If you have feedback on them, please let us know via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug&template=bug_report.md), in the [Kotlin Slack community](https://slack.kotl.in/), or in the [GraphQL nullability working group](https://github.com/graphql/nullability-wg/).

</ExperimentalFeature>

## Introduction

_This section is a high level description of nullability and errors in GraphQL and the problem it causes for app developers. For the proposed solution, skip directly to the [@semanticNonNull](#semanticnonnull) section._  

GraphQL does not have a `Result` type. If a field errors, it is set to `null` in the JSON response and an error is added to the `errors` array. 

From the schema alone, it is impossible to tell if `null` is a valid business value or only happens for errors:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  # Should the UI deal with user without a name here? It's impossible to tell.
  name: String
  avatarUrl: String
}
```

The GraphQL best practices recommend making fields nullable by default to account for errors. 

From [graphql.org](https://graphql.org/learn/best-practices/#nullability):

<blockquote style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.05)">

_In a GraphQL type system, every field is nullable by default.
This is because there are many things that can go awry in a networked
service backed by databases and other services._

</blockquote>

For an example, the following query:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user {
    id
    name
    avatarUrl
  }
}
```

receives a response like so in the case of an error:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "1001",
      "name": null,
      "avatarUrl": "https://example.com/pic.png"
    }
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Cannot resolve user.name",
      "path": ["user", "name"]
    }
  ]
}
```

This nullable default has one major drawback for frontend developers. It requires to carefully check every field in your UI code.

Sometimes it's not clear how to handle the different cases:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun User(user: GetUserQuery.User) {
  if (user.name != null) {
    Text(text = user.name)
  } else {
    // What to do here? 
    // Is it an error? 
    // Is it a true null?
    // Should I display a placeholder? an error? hide the view?
  }
}
```

When there are a lot of fields, handling the `null` case on every one of them becomes really tedious. 

Apollo Kotlin offers nullability directives to deal with this situation:
* [`@semanticNonNull`](#semanticnonnull) (schema directive)
* [`@catch`](#handle-errors-and-receive-partial-data-with-catch) (client directive)

These tools change the GraphQL default from "handle every field error" to "opt-in the errors you want to handle".

## Enabling error aware parsing

To make the Apollo generated parsers aware of errors, import the [nullability directives](https://specs.apollo.dev/nullability/v0.4/) using the [`@link` directive](https://specs.apollo.dev/link/v1.0/):

```graphql
extend schema @link(
  url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/nullability/v0.4", 
  import: ["@semanticNonNull", "@semanticNonNullField", "@catch", "CatchTo", "@catchByDefault"]
)
```

And define the default behavior when an error happens. 

You may catch the error and expose it as a `FieldResult`:

```graphql
# Catch the error and expose it as a FieldResult<T> in the generated models.
extend schema @catchByDefault(to: RESULT)
```

or re-throw the error:

```graphql
# Re-throw the error. If no parent field catches it, `response.exception` contains an instance of `ApolloGraphQLException`.  
extend schema @catchByDefault(to: THROW)
```

or coerce the error to `null`, like the current GraphQL default:

```graphql
# Coerce the error to null. The caller must read `response.errors` to disambiguate a null vs error field. 
extend schema @catchByDefault(to: NULL)
```

Adding `@catchByDefault(to: NULL)` is a no-op for codegen that unlocks using `@catch` in your operations.

Because errors can never happen on non-null fields (`String!` and others), `@catchByDefault` only influences the nullable fields in your schema.

Some of those fields are only nullable for error reasons. For those cases, Apollo Kotlin supports `@semanticNonNull`.

## `@semanticNonNull`

`@semanticNonNull` introduces a new type in the GraphQL type system. 

A `@semanticNonNull` type can never be null **except** if there is an error in the errors array.

Use it in your schema:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  # name is never null unless there is an error
  name: String @semanticNonNull
  # avatarUrl may be null even if there is no error. In that case the UI should be prepared to display a placeholder. 
  avatarUrl: String
}
```

<Note>

`@semanticNonNull` is a directive so that it can be introduced without breaking the current GraphQL tooling but the ultimate goal is to introduce new syntax. See the [nullability working group discussion](https://github.com/graphql/nullability-wg/discussions/58) for more details.

</Note>

For fields of `List` type, `@semanticNonNull` applies only to the first level. If you need to apply it to a given level, use the `levels` argument:

```graphql
type User {
  # adminRoles may be null if the user is not an admin  
  # if the user is an admin, adminRoles[i] is never null unless there is also an error
  adminRoles: [AdminRole] @semanticNonNull(levels: [1])
}
```

With `@semanticNonNull`, a frontend developer knows that a given field will never be null in regular operation and can therefore act accordingly. The Apollo Kotlin codegen generates `@semanticNonNull` fields as non-null Kotlin properties. No need to guess anymore! 

Ideally, your backend team annotates their schema with `@semanticNonNull` directives so that different frontend teams can benefit from the new type information. 

Sometimes this process takes time. 

For these situations, you can extend your schema by using `@semanticNonNullField` in your extra.graphqls file:

```graphql
# Same effect as above but works as a schema extensions
extend type User @semanticNonNullField(name: "name")
```

You can later share that file with your backend team and double check that your interpretation of the types is the correct one.

## `@catch`

While `@semanticNonNull` is a server directive that describes your data, `@catch` is a client directive that defines how to handle errors.

`@catch` allows to:
* handle errors as `FieldResult<T>`, getting access to the colocated error.
* throw the error and let another parent field handle it or bubble up to `data == null`. 
* coerce the error to `null` (current GraphQL default).

For fields of `List` type, `@catch` applies only to the first level. If you need to apply it to a given level, use the `levels` argument:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user {
    # map friends[i] to FieldResult
    friends @catch(to: RESULT, levels: [1])
  }
}
```

### Colocate errors

To get colocated errors, use `@catch(to: RESULT)`:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user {
    id
    # map name to FieldResult<String> instead of stopping parsing
    name @catch(to: RESULT)
  }
}
```

The above query generates the following Kotlin code:

```kotlin
class User(
    val id: String,
    // note how String is not nullable. This is because name 
    // was marked `@semanticNonNull` in the previous section.
    val name: FieldResult<String>,
)
```

Use `getOrNull()` to get the value:

```kotlin
println(user.name.getOrNull()) // "Luke Skywalker"
// or you can also decide to throw on error
println(user.name.getOrThrow())
```

And `graphQLErrorOrNull()` to get the colocated error:

```kotlin
println(user.name.graphQLErrorOrNull()) // "Cannot resolve user.name"
```

### Throw errors

To throw errors, use `@catch(to: THROW)`:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user {
    id
    # throw any error 
    name @catch(to: THROW)
  }
}
```

The above query generates the following Kotlin code:

```kotlin
class User(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
)
```

<Note>

The error is thrown during parsing but still caught before it reaches your UI code. If no parent field catches it, the Apollo Kotlin runtime will and set it as `ApolloResponse.exception`. 

</Note>  

### Coerce errors to null

To coerce errors to `null` (current GraphQL default), use `@catch(to: NULL)`:

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user {
    id
    # coerce errors to null 
    name @catch(to: NULL)
  }
}
```

The above query generates the following Kotlin code:

```kotlin
class User(
    val id: String,
    // Note how name is nullable again despite being marked
    // @semanticNonNull in the schema
    val name: String?,
)
```

<Note>

The error is thrown during parsing but still caught before it reaches your UI code. If no parent field catches it, the Apollo Kotlin runtime does and exposes the exception in `ApolloResponse.exception`. 

</Note>

## Migrate to semantic nullability

Semantic nullability is the most useful for schemas that are nullable by default. These are the schemas that require "handling every field error". 

In order to change that default to "opt-in the errors you want to handle", you can use the following approach:

1. import the nullability directives.
1. Default to coercing to null: `extend schema @catchByDefault(to: NULL)`. This is a no-op to start exploring the directives.
1. Add `@catch` to individual fields, get more comfortable with how it works.
1. When ready to do the big switch, change to `extend schema catchByDefault(to: THROW)` and (at the same time) add `query GetFoo @catchByDefault(to: NULL) {}` on all operations/fragments (this is a no-op).
1. From this moment on, new queries written throw on errors by default.
1. Remove `query GetFoo @catchByDefault(to: NULL) {}` progressively.

## Migrate from `@nonnull`

If you were using `@nonnull` before, you can now use `@semanticNonNull`. 

`@semanticNonNull`, coupled with `@catch` is more flexible and also more in line with other frameworks. 

Catch to NULL by default:

```graphql
extend schema @link(
  url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/nullability/v0.4", 
  import: ["@semanticNonNull", "@semanticNonNullField", "@catch", "CatchTo", "@catchByDefault"]
)

extend schema @catchByDefault(to: NULL)
```

Replace `@nonnull` with `@semanticNonNullField`: 

```graphql
# Replace
extend type Foo @nonnull(fields: "bar")

# With
extend type Foo @semanticNonNullField(name: "bar")
```

In your queries, use `@catch(to: THROW)` to generate those fields as non-nullable:

```graphql
# Add `@catch(to: THROW)` 
query GetFoo {
  foo @catch(to: THROW)
}
```


**For usages in executable documents**

Because nullability is a schema concern, `@semanticNonNull` cannot be used in executable documents. Instead, define your fields as `@semanticNonNull`: 

```graphql
# Replace 
query GetFoo {
  foo @nonnull
}

# With
query GetFoo {
  foo @catch(to: THROW)
}

# and make foo `@semanticNonNull` in your schema
extends type Query @semanticNonNullField(name: "foo")
```
