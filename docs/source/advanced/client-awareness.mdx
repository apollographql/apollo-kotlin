title: Client Awareness
---

GraphOS Studio users can opt in [Client Awareness](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/metrics/client-awareness/). Client Awareness allows you to view operation metrics split per client, helping you understand how each one interacts with your graph.

Client Awareness uses `apollographql-client-name` and `apollographql-client-version` custom HTTP headers to report client usage.

Enable it by adding an `ApolloClientAwarenessInterceptor` to your `ApolloClient`:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
    .addHttpInterceptor(ApolloClientAwarenessInterceptor(BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID, BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME))
    .build()
```

<Note>

This example uses `BuildConfig` to set the app's `applicationId` as the client name and its `versionName` as the client version, but you can override this. Especially, if your iOS and Android apps use the same package name, it's useful to customize it to be able to differentiate the clients.
