title: Monitoring the network state to reduce latency
---

Android and Apple targets provide APIs to monitor the network state of your device:

- [ConnectivityManager](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/) on Android targets.
- [NWPathMonitor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/network/nwpathmonitor) on Apple targets.

You can configure your [ApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/kdoc/apollo-runtime/com.apollographql.apollo3/-apollo-client/index.html) to use these APIs to improve latency of your requests using the `NetworkMonitor` API:

```kotlin
// androidMain
val networkMonitor = NetworkMonitor(context)

// appleMain
val networkMonitor = NetworkMonitor()

// commonMain
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
    .networkMonitor(networkMonitor)
    .build()
```

### `failFastIfOffline`

When a `NetworkMonitor` is configured, you can use `failFastIfOffline` to avoid trying out request if the device is offline:

```kotlin
// Opt-in `failFastIfOffline` on all queries
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
    .failFastIfOffline(true)
    .build()

val response = apolloClient.query(myQuery).execute()
println(response.exception?.message)
// "The device is offline"

// Opt-out `failFastIfOffline` on a single query
val response = apolloClient.query(myQuery).failFastIfOffline(false).execute()
```

### `retryOnError`

When a `NetworkMonitor` is configured, `retryOnError` uses `NetworkMonitor.waitForNetwork()` instead of the default exponential backoff algorithm in order to reconnect faster when connectivity is back.

### customizing the retry algorithm

You can customize the retry algorithm further by defining you won interceptor. Make sure to:

- add your interceptor last, so that it wraps the network call and doesn't get cache misses or any other errors that may be emitted by upstream interceptors.
- call `retryOnError(false)` when forwarding the request downstream so that the retry is not made twice.

```kotlin
internal class MyRetryInterceptor(private val networkMonitor: NetworkMonitor?): ApolloInterceptor {
  override fun <D : Operation.Data> intercept(request: ApolloRequest<D>, chain: ApolloInterceptorChain): Flow<ApolloResponse<D>> {
    // Disable Apollo's built-in retry mechanism
    val newRequest = request.newBuilder().retryOnError(false).build()
    return chain.proceed(newRequest)
        .onEach { 
          if (it.exception != null && it.exception.shouldRetry()) {
            throw RetryException
          }
        }.retryWhen { cause, _-> 
          if (cause is RetryException) {
            // Add your logic here
            true
          } else {
            // Programming error, re-throw it
            false
          }
        }
  }
}
```
