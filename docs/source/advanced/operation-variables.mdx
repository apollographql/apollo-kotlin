GraphQL supports passing argument values to your operations with [variables](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/passing-arguments/). This enables you to write a single query that you can reuse with multiple variable values (this is a [recommended best practice](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/operation-best-practices/#use-variables-to-provide-graphql-arguments)).

In GraphQL, non-nullable variables are required, and nullable variables are optional. However, because variables are rarely omitted in practice, Apollo Android provides a mechanism to make variables non-optional in generated code. This makes the structure of generated code more straightforward.

Since you may still need to omit variables, the default is to generate them as optional, but this can be configured (on specific variables, or globally).

Consider the following GraphQL query with two nullable variables:

```graphql
query GetTodos($first: Int, $offset: Int) {
  todos(first: $first, offset: $offset) {
    id
    text
  }
}
```

Apollo Android generates the following Kotlin code for this query:

```kotlin
class GetTodosQuery(val first: Optional<Int?>, val offset: Optional<Int?>)
```

You can then selectively provide or omit variable values:

```kotlin
// Omit values for both variables
val query = GetTodosQuery(Optional.Absent, Optional.Absent)
// Provide null for both variables
val query = GetTodosQuery(Optional.Present(null), Optional.Present(null))
// Send explicit values for both variables
val query = GetTodosQuery(Optional.Present(100), Optional.Present(0))
```

## Make nullable variables non optional

To disable optional variables globally, update your Gradle config:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // ...
  generateOptionalOperationVariables.set(false)
}
```

In that case, in the example of the query seen above, Apollo Android generates the following Kotlin code:

```kotlin
class GetTodosQuery(val first: Int?, val offset: Int?)
```

This makes the calling code less verbose to use:

```kotlin
// Provide null for both variables
val query = GetTodosQuery(null, null)
// Send explicit values for both variables
val query = GetTodosQuery(100, 0)
```

If you pass `null` as the value for either of these variables, Apollo Android sends `null` to the server _as the value
of that variable_ instead of omitting it entirely.

While doing this could simplify your code globally, you may still need to omit variables in certain cases. To that
effect, optional can be opted back in on a per-variable basis, by setting the `@optional` directive:

```graphql{1}
query GetTodos($first: Int @optional, $offset: Int @optional) {
  todos(first: $first, offset: $offset) {
    id
    text
  }
}
```

In that case, Apollo Android generates code with `Optional` for these specific variables even though it has been opted
out globally.
