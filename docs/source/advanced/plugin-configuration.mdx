title: Gradle plugin configuration
---

Apollo Kotlin's default configuration works for the majority of use cases. If you're getting started, see the [getting started guide](../) for an overview of the default Gradle configuration.

This article describes configuration options for advanced use cases when using Gradle.

## Using multiple GraphQL APIs

Apollo Kotlin supports communicating with multiple GraphQL endpoints with different schemas. To do so, create multiple services like so:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("starwars") {
    srcDir("src/main/graphql/starwars")
    packageName.set("com.starwars")
  }
  service("githunt") {
    srcDir("src/main/graphql/githunt")
    packageName.set("com.githunt")
  }
}
```

## Specifying the schema location

Specify the location of your schema file using the `schemaFile` property:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    schemaFile.set(file("shared/graphql/schema.graphqls"))
  }
}
```

> By default, Apollo Kotlin combines all files in your project that match the pattern `schema.[graphqls|json|sdl]`.

## Combining multiple schema files

Apollo Kotlin supports a collection of client directives, including `@nonnull`, `@optional`, and `@typePolicy`. These directives enable you to extend your server's base schema with client-specific types and fields.

If you expand your schema in a separate file, you can instruct Apollo Kotlin to construct its schema from a combination of multiple files, like so:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    schemaFiles.setFrom("shared/graphql/schema.graphqls", "shared/graphql/extra.graphqls")
  }
}
```

> By default, Apollo Kotlin combines all files in your project that match the pattern `schema.[graphqls|json|sdl]`.

## Wiring generated source

By default, Apollo Kotlin adds generated source:

- to the `main` sourceSet for JVM projects
- to `commonMain` for multiplatform projects
- to all non-test variants for Android projects

You can customize this behavior with the `outputDirConnection` property. For example, to wire a service to the test source set of a Kotlin
JVM project:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    outputDirConnection {
      connectToKotlinSourceSet("test")
    }
  }
}
```

## Android variants support

It is sometimes useful to have different operations or schemas depending on the [variant](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants) of your Android project.

To do this, you can instruct the Gradle plugin to automatically configure a Service per variant, like so:

```kotlin
apollo {
  createAllAndroidVariantServices(sourceFolder = ".", nameSuffix = "") {
    // Configure the service here
    packageName.set("...")
  }
}
```

- `sourceFolder` where to find the GraphQL relative to "src/$sourceSetName/graphql". Pass "." to look into "src/$sourceSetName/graphql".
- `nameSuffix` a suffix to use for the service name. Leave blank to use the variant name as is.

Similarly to what the Android variant system does with source code, the GraphQL files are handled additively, and files in `src/main/graphql` are included in all services. This means your project could look like this (e.g. when certain operations must only exist in debug builds):

```
- main
    - graphql
        - schema.graphqls // Schema for all variants
        - operations.graphql // Operations shared by all variants
- debug
    - graphql
        - operations.graphql // Operations specific to the 'debug' build type
```

Or for instance like this (specific backend per flavor):

```
- main
- demo
    - graphql
        - schema.graphqls // Schema for the 'demo' flavor
        - operations.graphql // Operations specific to the 'demo' flavor
- full
    - graphql
        - schema.graphqls // Schema for the 'full' flavor
        - operations.graphql // Operations specific to the 'full' flavor
```

If you have many variants and don't need to configure an Apollo Service for each one of them, it may be simpler to declare the Services manually, for instance:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("debug") {
    srcDir(file("src/debug/graphql/"))
    packageName.set("com.example")
    outputDirConnection {
      connectToAndroidSourceSet("debug")
    }
  }
  service("release") {
    srcDir(file("src/release/graphql/"))
    packageName.set("com.example")
    outputDirConnection {
      connectToAndroidSourceSet("release")
    }
  }
}
```


## Downloading a schema

By default, the Gradle plugin registers a `downloadApolloSchema` task that you can use from the command line:

```bash
# --schema is interpreted relative to the project's root directory (can also be an absolute path). This example
# assumes the root project directory and an Android app in `app`
./gradlew downloadApolloSchema \
  --endpoint="https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint" \
  --schema="app/src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls"
```

If you're doing this often or want to automate the process from CI, you can configure an `introspection {}` block:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("starwars") {
    packageName.set("com.starwars")

    // This will create a downloadStarwarsApolloSchemaFromIntrospection task
    introspection {
      endpointUrl.set("https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint")
      // The path is interpreted relative to the current project here, no need to prepend 'app'
      schemaFile.set(file("src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls"))
    }
  }
}
```

This creates a task named `download<ServiceName>ApolloSchemaFromIntrospection`.

> [!NOTE]  
> It's a different task from the previous `downloadApolloSchema` one. Make sure to call `download<ServiceName>ApolloSchemaFromIntrospection`

If you register your schema with [Apollo Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/), use the `registry` block instead:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("starwars") {
    packageName.set("com.starwars")

    // This will create a downloadStarwarsApolloSchemaFromRegistry task
    registry {
      key.set(System.getenv("APOLLO_KEY"))
      graph.set(System.getenv("APOLLO_GRAPH"))
      // The path is interpreted relative to the current project here, no need to prepend 'app'
      schemaFile.set(file("src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls"))
    }
  }
}
```

This will create a task named `download<ServiceName>ApolloSchemaFromRegistry` (`downloadServiceApolloSchemaFromRegistry` by default).
