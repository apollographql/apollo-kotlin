title: Code generation methods in Apollo Android

Apollo Android provides multiple code generation engines (**codegens**) that you can choose from depending on your use case:


| Codegen | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `operationBased` (default) | Generates models according to the shape of each defined operation. |
| `responseBased` | <p>Generates models according to the shape of each operation's response.</p><p>Compared to `operationBased`, models generated by the `responseBased` codegen are more performant and expose more type information, at the cost of generating more total code. [See details.](#the-responsebased-codegen)  </p> |
| `compat` (deprecated) | Similar to `operationBased`, except it generates models that are compatible with Apollo Android v2. This codegen helps projects upgrade from v2 to v3. |

> ðŸ’¡ For more in-depth information on each codegen, see [this design document](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/blob/dev-3.x/design-docs/Codegen.md).


To use a particular codegen, configure `codegenModels` in your Gradle scripts:

```kotlin:title=build.gradle.kts
apollo {
    // ...
    codegenModels.set("responseBased")
}
```

## The `responseBased` codegen

The `responseBased` codegen differs from the `operationBased` codegen in the following ways:

* Generated models have a **1:1 mapping** with the JSON structure received in an operation's response.
* Polymorphism is handled by generating **interfaces**. Possible shapes are then defined as different classes that implement the corresponding interfaces.
* Fragments are also generated as **interfaces**.
* Any merged fields appear _once_ in generated models.

Let's look at examples using fragments to highlight some of these differences.

### Inline fragments

Consider this query:

```graphql{4-9}:title=HeroQuery.graphql
query HeroForEpisode($ep: Episode!) {
  hero(episode: $ep) {
    name
    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }
    ... on Human {
      height
    }
  }
}
```

If we run the `responseBased` codegen on this operation, it generates a `Hero` interface with three implementing classes:

* `DroidHero`
* `HumanHero`
* `OtherHero`

Because `Hero` is an interface with different implementations, you can use a `when` clause to handle each different case:

```kotlin
when (hero) {
  is DroidHero -> println(hero.primaryFunction)
  is HumanHero -> println(hero.height)
  else -> {
    // Account for other Hero types (including unknown ones)
    // Note: in this example `name` is common to all Hero types
    println(hero.name)
  }
}
```

#### Accessors

As a convenience, the `responseBased` codegen generates methods with the name pattern `as<ShapeName>` (e.g., `asDroid` or `asHuman`) that enable you to avoid manual casting:

```kotlin
val primaryFunction = hero1.asDroid().primaryFunction
val height = hero2.asHuman().height
```

### Named fragments

Consider this example:

```graphql{9-15}:title=HeroQuery.graphql
query HeroForEpisode($ep: Episode!) {
    hero(episode: $ep) {
        name
        ...DroidFields
        ...HumanFields
    }
}

fragment DroidFields on Droid {
    primaryFunction
}

fragment HumanFields on Human {
    height
}
```

The `responseBased` codegen generates interfaces for the `DroidFields` and `HumanFields` fragments:

```kotlin
interface DroidFields {
  val primaryFunction: String
}

interface HumanFields {
  val height: Double
}
```

These interfaces are implemented by subclasses of the generated `HeroForEpisodeQuery.Data.Hero` (and other models for any operations using
these fragments):

```kotlin:title=HeroForEpisodeQuery.kt
interface Hero {
  val name: String
}

data class DroidHero(
  override val name: String,
  override val primaryFunction: String
) : Hero, DroidFields

data class HumanHero(
  override val name: String,
  override val height: Double
) : Hero, HumanFields

data class OtherHero(
  override val name: String
) : Hero
```

This can be used like so:

```kotlin
when (hero) {
  is DroidFields -> println(hero.primaryFunction)
  is HumanFields -> println(hero.height)
}
```

#### Accessors

As a convenience, the `responseBased` codegen generates methods with the name pattern `<fragmentName>` (e.g., `droidFields` for a fragment named `DroidFields`). This enables you to chain calls together, like so:

```kotlin
val primaryFunction = hero1.droidFields().primaryFunction
val height = hero2.humanFields().height
```
