## Using multiple GraphQL APIs

Apollo Kotlin supports communicating with multiple GraphQL endpoints with different schemas. To do so, create multiple
services like so:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("starwars") {
    srcDir("src/main/graphql/starwars")
    packageName.set("com.starwars")
  }
  service("githunt") {
    srcDir("src/main/graphql/githunt")
    packageName.set("com.githunt")
  }
}
```

## Specifying the schema location

Specify the location of your schema file using the `schemaFiles` property:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    schemaFiles.from(file("shared/graphql/schema.graphqls"))
  }
}
```

<Note> 

> If `schemaFiles` is not set, Apollo Kotlin combines all `*.[graphqls|json|sdl]` files in `src/main/graphql/` (Android/JVM projects) or `src/commonMain/graphql/` (multiplatform projects).

</Note>

## Combining multiple schema files

Apollo Kotlin supports a collection of directives, such as `@semanticNonNull`, `@fieldPolicy`, `@typePolicy`. These
directives enable you to extend your server's base schema to work better with your client.

If you expand your schema in a separate file (usually named `extra.graphqls`), you can instruct Apollo Kotlin to construct its schema from a combination
of multiple files, like so:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    schemaFiles.from("shared/graphql/schema.graphqls", "shared/graphql/extra.graphqls")
  }
}
```

## Wiring generated sources

By default, Apollo Kotlin adds the generated sources:

- to the `main` sourceSet for JVM projects
- to `commonMain` for multiplatform projects
- to all non-test variants for Android projects

You can customize this behavior with the `outputDirConnection` property. For example, to wire a service to the test source set of a Kotlin JVM project:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    outputDirConnection {
      connectToKotlinSourceSet("test")
    }
  }
}
```

## Android variants support

It is sometimes useful to have different operations or schemas depending on the [variant](https://developer.android.com/build/build-variants) of your Android project.

To do this, you can instruct the Gradle plugin to automatically configure a Service per variant:

```kotlin
apollo {
  createAllAndroidVariantServices(sourceFolder = ".", nameSuffix = "") {
    // Configure the service here
    packageName.set("...")
  }
}
```

- `sourceFolder` is where to find the GraphQL relative to "src/$sourceSetName/graphql". Pass "." to look into "src/$sourceSetName/graphql".
- `nameSuffix` is the suffix to use for the service name. Leave blank to use the variant name as is.

Similarly to what the Android variant system does with source code, the GraphQL files are handled **additively**, and files in `src/main/graphql` are included in all services.

For instance, if certain operations should only exist in debug builds, your project structure could look like this:

```
- main
    - graphql
        - schema.graphqls // Schema for all variants
        - operations.graphql // Operations shared by all variants
- debug
    - graphql
        - operations.graphql // Operations specific to the 'debug' build type
```

Or if you have a specific backend per flavor, it could look like this:

```
- main
- demo
    - graphql
        - schema.graphqls // Schema for the 'demo' flavor
        - operations.graphql // Operations specific to the 'demo' flavor
- full
    - graphql
        - schema.graphqls // Schema for the 'full' flavor
        - operations.graphql // Operations specific to the 'full' flavor
```

If you have a lot of variants and don't need to configure an Apollo Service for each, it may be simpler to declare the Services manually rather than using `createAllAndroidVariantServices`. For instance:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("debug") {
    srcDir(file("src/debug/graphql/"))
    packageName.set("com.example")
    outputDirConnection {
      connectToAndroidSourceSet("debug")
    }
  }
  service("release") {
    srcDir(file("src/release/graphql/"))
    packageName.set("com.example")
    outputDirConnection {
      connectToAndroidSourceSet("release")
    }
  }
}
```

## Downloading a schema

The Apollo Gradle plugin has APIs to download a schema from introspection:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("starwars") {
    packageName.set("com.starwars")

    // This creates a downloadStarwarsApolloSchemaFromIntrospection task
    introspection {
      endpointUrl.set("https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint")
      // The path is interpreted relative to the current project
      schemaFile.set(file("src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls"))
    }
  }
}
```

This creates a task named `download${ServiceName}ApolloSchemaFromIntrospection`.

If introspection is disabled and your team is using [GraphOS](https://studio.apollographql.com/), use the `registry {}` block
instead:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("starwars") {
    packageName.set("com.starwars")

    // This creates a downloadStarwarsApolloSchemaFromRegistry task
    registry {
      key.set(System.getenv("APOLLO_KEY"))
      graph.set(System.geten("APOLLO_GRAPH"))
      // The path is interpreted relative to the current project here, no need to prepend 'app'
      schemaFile.set(file("src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls"))
    }
  }
}
```

This creates a task named `download${ServiceName}ApolloSchemaFromRegistry`.

With the [Android Studio plugin](../testing/android-studio-plugin), you can also go to <kbd>Tools</kbd> | <kbd>Apollo</kbd> | <kbd>Download schema</kbd> which acts as a shortcut to these tasks.

Alternatively, for one time downloads, you can also use the [Apollo Kotlin cli](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin-cli).

## Generated methods

By default, all Kotlin models, operations, fragments, and input objects are generated as data classes. This means that the Kotlin compiler will
auto-generate `toString`, `equals` `hashCode`, `copy` and `componentN` for most generated classes. If you don't think you need all of those
auto-generated methods, and/or you are worried about the size of the generated code, you can configure the Apollo compiler to generate none
or a subset of the data class methods. To do this, set `generateMethods` to a list of the methods you need. The available methods are:

- "equalsHashCode" generates `equals` and `hashCode` methods that will compare generated class properties.
- "toString" generates a method that will print a pretty string representing the data in the class.
- "copy" (Kotlin only) generates a method that will copy the class with named parameters and default values.
- "dataClass" (Kotlin only and redundant with all other methods) generates the class as a [data class](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html).
  which will automatically generate `toString`, `copy`, `equals` and `hashCode`.

Here are some possible configurations:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    // Generates equals and hashCode
    generateMethods.set(listOf("equalsHashCode"))
    // Generates toString, equals, and hashcode (the default for Java)
    generateMethods.set(listOf("equalsHashCode", "toString"))
    // Only generates copy
    generateMethods.set(listOf("copy"))
    // Generates data classes (the default for Kotlin)
    generateMethods.set(listOf("dataClass"))
  }
}
```
