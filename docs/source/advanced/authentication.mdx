title: Authenticate your operations

> Authentication is not included in the GraphQL specification. This page aims at giving some guidance for the most common scenarios but doesn't pretend to be exhaustive.

## Authenticating your HTTP requests with OkHttp

[OkHttp Interceptors](https://square.github.io/okhttp/features/interceptors/) are an easy way to add an `"Authorization"` header to your HTTP requests.

OkHttp Interceptors have been around for a long time and work well but only work on Android and the JVM.

## Authenticating your HTTP requests with Apollo HttpInterceptor

In order to authenticate your HTTP requests in a multi-platform way, you can use Apollo [HttpInterceptor](./interceptors-http).

HttpInterceptor is multiplatform and uses an API very similar to OkHttp's:

```kotlin
class AuthorizationInterceptor() : HttpInterceptor {
  private val mutex = Mutex()

  override suspend fun intercept(request: HttpRequest, chain: HttpInterceptorChain): HttpResponse {
    var token = mutex.withLock {
      // get current token
    }

    val response = chain.proceed(request.newBuilder().addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer $token").build())

    return if (response.statusCode == 401) {
      token = mutex.withLock {
        // get new token
      }
      chain.proceed(request.newBuilder().addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer $token").build())
    } else {
      response
    }
  }
}
```

## Authenticating your WebSockets

Authenticating WebSockets is typically handled with a specific connection payload:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .httpServerUrl("http://localhost:8080/graphql")
    .webSocketServerUrl("http://localhost:8080/subscriptions")
    .wsProtocol(
        SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory(
            connectionPayload = {
              mapOf("authorization" to token)  // highlight-line
            }
        )
    )
    .build()

```

Alternatively, you can also send headers in the initial WebSocket handshake request:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .httpServerUrl("http://localhost:8080/graphql")
    .subscriptionNetworkTransport(
        WebSocketNetworkTransport.Builder()
            .serverUrl("http://localhost:8080/subscriptions")
            .addHeader("Authorization", authorization) // highlight-line
             .build()
    )
    .build()
```
