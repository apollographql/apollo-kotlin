title: Connecting source sets
---

By default, Apollo Kotlin adds generated sources:

- to the `main` sourceSet for JVM projects
- to `commonMain` for multiplatform projects
- to all non-test variants for Android projects

You can customize this behavior with the `outputDirConnection` property. For example, to wire a service to the test source set of a Kotlin JVM project:

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    outputDirConnection {
      connectToKotlinSourceSet("test")
    }
  }
}
```
