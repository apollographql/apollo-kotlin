title: Connecting source sets
---

By default, Apollo Kotlin adds the generated files to the `main` (for JVM/Android projects) or `commonMain` (for multiplatform projects) source sets. 

If you only need them in a specific source set, you can use `outputDirConnection` to add them to a different source set.

For an example, you can add them to the "test" source set:

```kotlin
apollo {
  outputDirConnection {
    connectToKotlinSourceSet("test")
  }
}
```

On Android, because the generated files are added to the `main` source set, they are available in all your [build variants](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants#build-types). If you need them available to only a specific build variant, you can do so with:

```kotlin
apollo {
  outputDirConnection {
    connectToAndroidSourceSet("demoDebug")
  }
}
```
