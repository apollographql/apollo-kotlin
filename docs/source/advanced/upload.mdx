Apollo Kotlin supports file uploads via the [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

First, add the following custom scalar mapping to the Apollo Gradle plugin configuration:

```kotlin:title=build.gradle[.kts]
apollo {
  mapScalarToUpload("Upload")
}
```

In this example, the GraphQL schema defines a custom scalar type named `Upload`. You can use a different name as needed for your schema.

> **Note:** You don't need to register a type adapter for `Upload`, because the `mapScalarToUpload` method registers it automatically.

Now let's consider a mutation that takes an `Upload` as a parameter:

```graphql
mutation SingleUpload($file: Upload!) {
  singleUpload(file: $file) {
    id
    path
    filename
    mimetype
  }
}
```

Create an instance of `Upload` using one of the factory methods:

```kotlin
val upload = DefaultUpload.Builder()
              .content(okioSource)
              .build()

// or if you're on the JVM
val upload = DefaultUpload.Builder()
              .content(file)
              .build()
```

And execute your mutation:

```kotlin
val response = apolloClient.mutation(SingleUploadMutation(file = upload)).execute()
```
