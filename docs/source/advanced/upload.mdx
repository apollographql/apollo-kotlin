title: Uploading files
---

Apollo Android supports file uploading over [graphql-multipart-request-spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

You need to define this mapping in your build.gradle file.

```groovy
apollo {
  customScalarsMapping = [
    "Upload" : "com.apollographql.apollo3.api.Upload"
  ]
}
```

In this example, the GraphQL schema uses custom scalar type named `Upload` for file upload.
Change it to match your GraphQL schema.

You don't need to register a custom type adapter for `Upload`, the runtime will recognize it and use the appropriate adapter.

Create graphql mutation.

```graphql
mutation SingleUpload($file: Upload!) {
  singleUpload(file: $file) {
    id
    path
    filename
    mimetype
  }
}
```

Create an instance of `Upload` using one of the factory methods:

```kotlin
val upload = Upload.fromSource(okioSource)
// or if you're on the JVM
val upload = Upload.fromFile(file)
```

And execute your mutation:

```kotlin
val response = apolloClient.mutate(SingleUploadMutation(file = upload)).execute()
```
