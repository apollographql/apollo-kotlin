Apollo Kotlin supports file uploading following
the [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

First, add the following custom scalar mapping to the Apollo Gradle plugin configuration:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```groovy:title=build.gradle
apollo {
  customScalarsMapping = [
    "Upload" : "com.apollographql.apollo3.api.Upload"
  ]
}
```

```kotlin:title=build.gradle.kts
apollo {
  customScalarsMapping.set(mapOf(
    "Upload" to "com.apollographql.apollo3.api.Upload"
  ))
}
```
</MultiCodeBlock>

In this example, the GraphQL schema defines a custom scalar type named `Upload` - adapt it to match your own GraphQL
schema.

Note: you don't need to register a type adapter for `Upload`, the runtime will recognize it and use the appropriate
adapter.

Now let's consider a mutation that takes an `Upload` as a parameter:

```graphql
mutation SingleUpload($file: Upload!) {
  singleUpload(file: $file) {
    id
    path
    filename
    mimetype
  }
}
```

Create an instance of `Upload` using one of the factory methods:

```kotlin
val upload = DefaultUpload.Builder()
              .content(okioSource)
              .build()

// or if you're on the JVM
val upload = DefaultUpload.Builder()
              .file(file)
              .build()
```

And execute your mutation:

```kotlin
val response = apolloClient.mutation(SingleUploadMutation(file = upload)).execute()
```
