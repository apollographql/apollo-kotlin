title: Use your own HTTP client
---

By default, Apollo Android uses [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) on Android and [NSURLSesssion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsession) on iOS/MacOS to execute your HTTP queries.

In order to customize your HTTP requests, Apollo Android offers several solutions:

1. [No runtime](no-runtime): You can opt-out the runtime completely and only use generated models and parsers. Use this option if you don't need any of the runtime features (caching, batching, automatic persisted queries, etc)
2. [HTTP interceptors](interceptors-http): If you're looking at adding extra HTTP headers and/or logging to your requests, [HTTP interceptors](interceptors-http) are an easy way to customize the HTTP execution with minimal code.
3. HTTP engine (this page): If you want to continue using the runtime features while customizing some aspects of the clients that are not possible with HTTP interceptors (like threading or connection pooling for an example), you can replace the default HTTP engine with a custom one.

This page is about option 3. and shows how to use your own HTTP client.

## Implementing HttpEngine

To use your own HTTP client, implement the [HttpEngine](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-android/kdoc/apollo-runtime/com.apollographql.apollo3.network.http/-http-engine/index.html) interface. The details will depend on your actual client but it can look like below:

```kotlin
class MyHttpEngine(val wrappedClient: MyClient) : HttpEngine {
  /**
   * Helper function to map the Apollo requests to MyClient requests
   */
  private fun HttpMethod.toMyClientRequest(): MyClientRequest {
    ...
  }

  /**
   * And the other way around
   */
  private fun MyClientResponse.toApolloResponse(): HttpResponse {
    ...
  }

  override suspend fun execute(request: HttpRequest) = suspendCancellableCoroutine { continuation ->

    val call = wrappedClient.newCall(request.toMyClientRequest())
    continuation.invokeOnCancellation {
      // If the coroutine is cancelled, also cancel the HTTP call
      call.cancel()
    }

    wrappedClient.enqueue(
        call,
        success = { myResponse ->
          // Success! report the response
          continuation.resume(myResponse.toApolloResponse())
        },
        error = { throwable ->
          // Error. Wrap in an ApolloException and report the error
          continuation.resumeWithException(ApolloNetworkException(throwable))
        }
    )
  }

  override fun dispose() {
    // Dispose any resources here
  }
}
```

This example shows an asynchronous wrappedClient that runs the network request from a separate thread but since `HttpEngine.execute` is called from a background thread itself, it is also ok to block in `execute()`.

## Use your HttpEngine

Once you have implemented your HttpEngine, you can register it in your [ApolloClient](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-android/kdoc/apollo-runtime/com.apollographql.apollo3/-apollo-client/index.html) using [HttpNetworkTransport](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-android/kdoc/apollo-runtime/com.apollographql.apollo3.network.http/-http-network-transport/index.html):

```kotlin
// Use your HttpEngine
val client = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .networkTransport(
        HttpNetworkTransport(
            serverUrl = "https://com.example/graphql",
            engine = MyHttpEngine(wrappedClient)
        )
    )
    .build()
```

This is everything needed. Your GraphQL queries will then use `MyHttpEngine` to execute the HTTP requests.
