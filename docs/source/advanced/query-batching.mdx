title: Query batching
---

Apollo Android supports batching queries as a means to reduce the number of HTTP round trips. When enabled, operations
executed consecutively in a short period of time will be sent to the server together in a single HTTP request.

Note that this network optimization comes at the price of increased latency as every request in the batch is now as slow
as the slowest one.

Here is how to enable batching:

```kotlin{3}
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .httpEngine(BatchingHttpEngine())
    .build()
```

By default, batched operations will be sent after 10 ms, or when 10 of them have been accumulated, but this can be
configured:

```kotlin
BatchingHttpEngine(
    batchIntervalMillis = 50,
    maxBatchSize = 20
)
```

## Opting in/out

If you need to disable batching for a specific operation, you can do so by using the `canBeBatched` extension:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(MyQuery()).canBeBatched(false).execute()
```

The default behavior is to have batching enabled for all operations, unless opting-out. If instead you want it to be
disabled by default and enable it only for specific operations, you can do so by setting `canBeBatched(false)` on
the `ApolloClient`:

```kotlin{4}
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .httpEngine(BatchingHttpEngine())
    .canBeBatched(false)
    .build()
```

With this, only operations executed with `canBeBatched(true)` will be batched.
