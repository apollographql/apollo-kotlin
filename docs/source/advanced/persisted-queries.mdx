Hashed queries are also sent by default using HTTP `GET` instead of the default `POST`, making them easier to cache in your edge network.

## Differences between persisted queries and APQs

<ClientPQDifferences />

## Implementation steps

Both persisted queries and APQs require you to configure how your client makes requests. If you intend to use persisted queries for safelisting, you also need to generate and publish an operation manifest.

<ClientPQImplementation />

### 0. Requirements

You can use APQs with the following versions of Apollo Kotlin, Apollo Server, and Apollo Router:
- Apollo Kotlin (v1.0.0+)
- [Apollo Server](/apollo-server/) (v1.0.0+)
- [Apollo Router](/router) (v0.1.0+)

> **Note:** You can use _either_ Apollo Server _or_ Apollo Router for APQs. They don't need to be used together.

Using persisted queries for safelisting has the following requirements:
- Apollo Kotlin (v3.8.2+)
- [Apollo Router](/router) (v1.25.0+)
- [GraphOS Enterprise plan](/graphos/enterprise/)

### 1. Generate operation manifest

> This step is only required for implementing safelisting with persisted queries. It is _not_ required for APQs.

The operation manifest acts as a safelist of trusted operations the [Apollo Router](/router/) can check incoming requests against. 
To generate the operation manifest, set `operationManifestFormat` to `"persistedQueryManifest"` in your Gradle script:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
apollo {
  service("api") {
    packageName.set("com.example")
    
    // Enable generation of the operation manifest
    operationManifestFormat.set("persistedQueryManifest") // highlight-line 
  }
}
```

The operation manifest is generated during code generation. This happens automatically every time you build your project or you can trigger it manually by executing the `generateApolloSources` Gradle task. 

The operation manifest is generated in `build/generated/manifest/apollo/$serviceName/persistedQueryManifest.json`, where `$serviceName` is `"api"` here. The resulting operation manifest looks something like this:

```json title="persistedQueryManifest.json"
{
  "format": "apollo-persisted-query-manifest",
  "version": 1,
  "operations": [
    {
      "id": "e0321f6b438bb42c022f633d38c19549dea9a2d55c908f64c5c6cb8403442fef",
      "body": "query GetItem { thing { __typename } }",
      "name": "GetItem",
      "type": "query"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Publish operation manifest

> This step is only required for implementing safelisting with persisted queries. It is _not_ required for APQs.

<PublishPQMs />

### 3. Enable persisted queries on `ApolloClient`

Once you've configured your code generation to include operation IDs, you can update your client to query by operation ID rather than the full operation string. This configuration is the same whether you're using APQs or persisted queries. Call `autoPersistedQueries()` on your `ApolloClient.Builder`:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .autoPersistedQueries()
  .build()
```

Once APQs are enabled on your ApolloClient, hashed queries are sent by default.

You may want to disable automatic persisted queries for certain queries, for instance to avoid any caching when the data is updated often. To do that, set `enableAutoPersistedQueries` to false on the `ApolloCall`:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(myQuery).enableAutoPersistedQueries(false).toFlow()
```

## Generating custom IDs for persisted queries

By default, Apollo uses `Sha256` hashing algorithm to generate an ID for the query. To provide custom ID generation logic, use the `operationIdGenerator` option. It accepts an `instance` that implements the `OperationIdGenerator` interface (`com.apollographql.apollo3.compiler.OperationIdGenerator`) as the input. You can use this option to either specify a different hashing algorithm or to fetch the persisted query ID from a different location, for example, from a service or a CLI.

Example Md5 hash generator:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    operationIdGenerator.set(object : com.apollographql.apollo3.compiler.OperationIdGenerator {
      override val version = "my-md5-version1"

      override fun apply(operationDocument: String, operationName: String): String {
        return operationDocument.md5()
      }
    })
  }
}
```

```groovy
import com.apollographql.apollo3.compiler.OperationIdGenerator

apollo {
  service("service") {
    operationIdGenerator = new OperationIdGenerator() {
      String apply(String operationDocument, String operationName) {
        return operationDocument.md5()
      }

      /**
       * Use this version override to indicate an update to the implementation.
       * This forces gradle to recompile models.
       */
      String version = "my-md5-v1"
    }
  }
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### ID generator versioning

The result of the ID generator is cached. The cache is not updated when the implementation of the ID Generator changes. To indicate an update to the implementation of the ID Generator, change the `version` override as shown in the above example.
