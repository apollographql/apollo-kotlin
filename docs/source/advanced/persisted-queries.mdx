title: Persisted queries in Apollo Kotlin
---

## Automatic persisted queries

Apollo Kotlin supports [Automatic Persisted Queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/) (APQ). To take advantage of it, your GraphQL server _also_ needs to support APQ (Apollo Server supports it out of the box).

Enable the feature when you initialize your `ApolloClient` instance, like so:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .autoPersistedQueries()
  .build()
```

You can optionally configure the HTTP methods to use. Using `GET` may take advantage of HTTP caching for instance when using a CDN:
```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .autoPersistedQueries(
        // For the initial hashed query that does not send the actual Graphql document
        httpMethodForHashedQueries = HttpMethod.Get,
        
        // For the follow-up query that sends the full document if the initial hashed query was not found
        httpMethodForDocumentQueries = HttpMethod.Get
    )
    .build()
```

Note that mutations will always be sent as `POST` requests, regardless of these settings, as to avoid hitting caches.

## Disable persisted queries for certain queries

You may want to disable persisted queries for certain queries, for instance to avoid any caching when the data is updated often. In order to do that, set `enableAutoPersistedQueries` to false on the `ApolloCall`:
```kotlin
apolloClient.query(myQuery).enableAutoPersistedQueries(false).toFlow()
```

## operationOutput.json

If your backend uses custom persisted queries, Apollo Kotlin can generate an OperationOutput json from your .graphql queries. They will match what the client is sending exactly so you can persist them on your server.

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    generateOperationOutput.set(true)
  }
}
```

## Custom ID for Persisted Queries

By default, Apollo uses `Sha256` hashing algorithm to generate an ID for the query. To provide custom ID generation logic, use the option - `operationIdGenerator` which accepts an `instance` that implements the `OperationIdGenerator` interface (`com.apollographql.apollo3.compiler.OperationIdGenerator`) as the input. This option can be used to either specify a different hashing algorithm or to fetch the persisted query ID from a different place - e.g. a service or a CLI.

Example Md5 hash generator:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    operationIdGenerator.set(object : com.apollographql.apollo3.compiler.OperationIdGenerator {
      override val version = "my-md5-version1"

      override fun apply(operationDocument: String, operationName: String): String {
        return operationDocument.md5()
      }
    })
  }
}
```

```groovy
import com.apollographql.apollo3.compiler.OperationIdGenerator

apollo {
  service("service") {
    operationIdGenerator = new OperationIdGenerator() {
      String apply(String operationDocument, String operationName) {
        return operationDocument.md5()
      }

      /**
       * Use this version override to indicate an update to the implementation.
       * This forces gradle to recompile models.
       */
      String version = "my-md5-v1"
    }
  }
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### Versioning Id Generator

The result of the ID generator is cached. The cache is not updated when the implementation of the ID Generator changes. To indicate an update to the implementation of the ID Generator, change the `version` override as shown in the above example.
