Apollo Kotlin requires your GraphQL server's schema as either an introspection or SDL schema. Usually, it's a `schema.[graphqls|json|sdl]` file. This section shows how to obtain a schema from your server using introspection.

> **Note**: If you don't have a GraphQL server yet, you can use the server from the [tutorial](/tutorial/00-introduction/): https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql.

The Apollo Gradle plugin exposes a `downloadApolloSchema` task to help you obtain your schema. Provide this task your server's GraphQL endpoint and the output location for the `schema.graphqls` file:

```bash:title=(shell)
# Create a directory for your GraphQL files:
mkdir -p app/src/main/graphql/com/example/

# --schema is interpreted relative to the current working directory. This example
# assumes the root project directory and an Android app in `app`
./gradlew downloadApolloSchema \
  --endpoint="https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint" \
  --schema="app/src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls"
```

If your GraphQL endpoint requires authentication, you can pass custom HTTP headers:

```bash:title=(shell)
./gradlew downloadApolloSchema \
  --endpoint="https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint" \
  --schema="app/src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls" \
  --header="Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
