title: "2. Add the GraphQL schema"
---

This tutorial uses a modified version of the GraphQL server you build as part of [the Apollo full-stack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/). You can visit [that server's Apollo Studio Sandbox Explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fapollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com) to explore its schema without needing to be logged in:

You'll know that this Sandbox instance is pointed at our server because its URL, `https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com`, is in the box at the top left of the page. If Sandbox is properly connected, you'll see a green dot:

The schema defines which GraphQL operations your server can execute. At the top left, click the schema icon to get an overview of your schema:

In the **Reference** tab, you can now see a list of all of the things available to you as a consumer of this API, along with available fields on all objects:

## Download your server's schema

Apollo Kotlin requires a schema to generate type-safe models and code from your queries. There are multiple ways to get a schema. For example, you can go to the SDL tab and download the raw SDL schema using Apollo Studio Sandbox.

In this tutorial, we will use the `apolloDownloadSchema` Gradle task that is created by our plugin automatically. Since GraphQL supports [introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/), this will work with any GraphQL endpoint that has introspection enabled.

From the root of the project, run the following in Android Studio's Terminal tab:

```shell:title=(shell)
./gradlew :app:downloadApolloSchema --endpoint='https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql' --schema='app/src/main/graphql/com/example/rocketreserver/schema.graphqls'
```

This will download a `schema.graphqls` file from your endpoint to `app/src/main/graphql/com/example/rocketreserver/schema.graphqls`.

Next, [write your first query](03-write-your-first-query) that uses this schema.
