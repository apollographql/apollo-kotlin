title: "2. Add the GraphQL schema"
---

This tutorial uses a modified version of the GraphQL server you build as part of [the Apollo full-stack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/). You can visit [`https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/`](https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/) to start it up and open the GraphQL Playground tool to explore its schema.

The [schema](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/) defines which GraphQL operations your server can execute. Click **Docs** on the right-hand side to view a list of types you can query (and the types of fields on those types) along with any possible mutations or subscriptions.

## Download your server's schema

Apollo Android requires a schema to generate typesafe models and code from your queries. There are multiple ways to get a schema. For an example, you can download a json schema directly from GraphQL Playground by clicking **Schema > Download** in the right pane.

In this tutorial, we will use the `apolloDownloadSchema` task that is created by the plugin automatically. Since GraphQL supports [introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/), this will work with any GraphQL endpoint that has introspection enabled.

From the root of the project, run the following:

```shell:title=(shell)
mkdir -p app/src/main/graphql/com/example/rocketreserver/
./gradlew :app:downloadApolloSchema -Pcom.apollographql.apollo.endpoint='https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/' -Pcom.apollographql.apollo.schema='src/main/graphql/com/example/rocketreserver/schema.json'
```

This will download a `schema.json` file from your endpoint to `app/src/main/graphql/com/example/rocketserver/schema.json`.

Next, [write your first query](03-write-your-first-query) that uses this schema.
