In this step, you'll import the starter project and add the Apollo Android SDK to it.

## Clone the starter project

```
git clone https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android-tutorial
cd apollo-android-tutorial
git checkout initial
```

At any time, if you want to view a completed version of the project, checkout the `main` branch.

## Open the project in Android Studio

Android Studio will take some time to index the contents of the project. Take some time to look around. You should see 3 Fragments:

* `LaunchListFragment` is the first fragment. You will display a list of launches there.
* `LaunchDetailsFragment` will display details about a launch and give you the opportunity to book a seat.
* `LoginFragment` will allow you to log in before booking the seat.

Now build and run the project. You should see an empty app:

<img src="images/initial.png" alt="The initial state of the project!" class="screenshot" width="300"/>

Now you will add Apollo Android to the project.

## Get the latest version of Apollo Android

You can find the latest version of Apollo Android from the [github releases page](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/releases). It is also displayed at the top of the [apollo-android repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/).

This tutorial uses `2.5.9` because it is the latest version at the time of writing. Feel free to use a more recent version if one is available.

## Apply the plugin

Apply the Apollo plugin in `app/build.gradle.kts`. There are two `build.gradle.kts` in the project. Make sure to use the one in the `app` directory this time. The Apollo plugin ID is `com.apollographql.apollo`.

```kotlin title="app/build.gradle.kts"
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    // ...
    id("com.apollographql.apollo").version("2.5.9")
}
```

The plugin contains the compiler that will generate models from your queries when you build your project.

## Configure Kotlin

Configure the Apollo plugin to generate Kotlin files instead of Java files. Put this at the end of `app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin title="app/build.gradle.kts"
apollo {
    generateKotlinModels.set(true)
}
```

## Add dependencies

Now add `apollo-runtime` and `apollo-coroutines-support` to the list of dependencies. This is the actual code that will run on the device and help schedule queries.

```groovy title="app/build.gradle.kts"
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-runtime:2.5.9")
    implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-coroutines-support:2.5.9")
    // ...
}
```

Android Studio will display a yellow banner, `A project sync may be necessary for the IDE to work properly.` Click **Sync Now**.

If everything goes well, Apollo Android is now added to your project. Next, you will [add the GraphQL schema to the project](02-add-the-graphql-schema).
