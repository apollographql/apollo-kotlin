Welcome! This tutorial demonstrates adding the Apollo Android SDK to an app to communicate with a GraphQL server. In this tutorial you will learn how to:

* Download a schema
* Write queries and mutations to generate the corresponding Kotlin models
* Handle errors and loading states
* Handle pagination
* Authenticate with a back-end server

The tutorial uses an instance of [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) hosted on Heroku, including the [corresponding GraphQL Playground](https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/). If you're curious about how to build your own server, see the [Apollo full-stack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/).

All of the code for this tutorial is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android-tutorial).

## What are you building?

In this tutorial, you'll build an app that allows you to book a seat on a rocket sent to space by [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/).

The tutorial uses the following tools and frameworks:

* [Android Studio 4.0.0](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* Kotlin and [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)
* [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding), [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started), [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout) and [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview).
* [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) for image loading.

To focus its scope, this tutorial uses a starter project available at https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android-tutorial so you can focus on the GraphQL parts.
