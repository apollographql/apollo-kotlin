title: "9. Write your first mutation"
---

In this section, you will write your first mutation to log in to the backend. 

A mutation is used to change data on your server. Here the login mutation will create a session based on your email address.

> **Note**: The way you log in to this particular server might differ from the way you log in with your own server. Login is often handled by _middleware_, or a layer totally separate from GraphQL, like [Oauth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth).
> Also note that a typical authentication flow should require a password but for this tutorial, anyone is allowed to book flights with a valid email address!


## Prototype your mutation in Sandbox Explorer

Open [your Sandbox Explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fapollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com) and click on the plus symbol to add a new tab. Next, click on the Schema icon to get back to looking at your schema, and select "Mutation" to look at your list of mutations: 

<img alt="The list of available mutations" class="screenshot" src="images/sandbox_schema_mutations.png"/>

Scroll down to take a look at the `login` mutation: 

<img alt="The definition of login in the schema" class="screenshot" src="images/schema_login_definition.png"/>

Click the play button to the right to open that mutation in the Explorer tab. When it opens, click the plus sign to add the operation: 

<img alt="The login mutation after initially being added" class="screenshot" src="images/explorer_added_login_mutation.png"/>

Sandbox Explorer tries to be helpful by adding the word `Mutation` after the word `Login`, but the Android SDK also does that for you automatically. Rename the operation `Login` instead: 

<img alt="The renamed operation" class="screenshot" src="images/explorer_login_mutation_rename.png"/>

Notice that there are no brackets after the call to the `login` mutation - this is because the type returned by this mutation is `String`, which is known as a **scalar type**. This means it won't have properties the way an object would, so you don't need to specify what properties you want returned to you. 

You'll also notice that `email` wasn't automatically added as an argument even though it doesn't seem to have a default value: That's because `email` is of type `String` - which remember, in GraphQL, means that it's **not** required (although obviously you won't get too far without it).  

Click the plus sign next to the `email` argument to have that argument added: 

<img alt="The operation with the email argument" class="screenshot" src="images/explorer_login_email_added.png"/>

You'll also notice that Sandbox Explorer has added a variable to your "Variables" section to match the login email. 

Click the Submit Operation button your mutation. You'll see that  since you sent `null` for the email address, you get back `null` for the login: 

<img alt="Results of passing a null email" class="screenshot" src="images/login_mutation_null.png"/>

Now, replace `null` in the Query Variables section with an actual email address:

```json:title=(Sandbox%20Explorer)
{ "loginEmail": "me@example.com" }
```

Press the Submit Operation button, and this time you'll get an actual response:

<img alt="Results of passing an actual email" class="screenshot" src="images/login_mutation_email.png"/>

Next, copy the operation, either manually or using the three-dot menu's "Copy operation" option. 		

## Add the mutation to the project

Now that your mutation is working, add it to your project. Create a file named `Login.graphql` next to `schema.graphqls` and your other GraphQL files and paste the contents of the mutation:

```graphql:title=app/src/main/graphql/com/example/rocketreserver/Login.graphql
mutation Login($email: String) {
  login(email: $email)
}
```

Build your project to generate the `LoginMutation` class.

## Connect the Submit button to your mutation

Open `LoginFragment.kt` and like you did for the other fragments, override `onViewCreated`. Add a click listener and some checks to verify that the email is a valid email:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LoginFragment.kt
    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)

        binding.submitProgressBar.visibility = View.GONE
        binding.submit.setOnClickListener {
            val email = binding.email.text.toString()
            if (!Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS.matcher(email).matches()) {
                binding.emailLayout.error = getString(R.string.invalid_email)
                return@setOnClickListener
            }
            
            // TODO: More code here
        }
    }
```

From the click listener, display the ProgressBar and execute the query with the email the user just entered. Replace the `TODO` with:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LoginFragment.kt
            binding.submitProgressBar.visibility = View.VISIBLE
            binding.submit.visibility = View.GONE
            lifecycleScope.launchWhenResumed {
                val response = try {
                    apolloClient.mutate(LoginMutation(email = email)).execute()
                } catch (e: Exception) {
                    null
                }
                
                // TODO: handle errors
            }
```

Handle errors if needed by replacing the `TODO` you just added:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LoginFragment.kt
                val login = response?.data?.login
                if (login == null || response.hasErrors()) {
                    binding.submitProgressBar.visibility = View.GONE
                    binding.submit.visibility = View.VISIBLE
                    return@launchWhenResumed
                }
```

Finally if everything is successful, store the login and go back to the previous screen at the end of `launchWhenResumed`:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LoginFragment.kt
                User.setToken(requireContext(), login)
                findNavController().popBackStack()
```

`User` is a helper class that saves the token in [EncryptedSharedPreference](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/security/crypto/EncryptedSharedPreferences). This is the reason why this tutorial uses API level 23+. Apollo Android itself supports API levels 19+.

## Test the login

Go to the details fragment, click **Book** and in the Login fragment, enter your email and click **Submit**. You now have a token that allows you to authenticate your operations.

In the next section, you will [use authenticated operations to book a flight](10-authenticate-your-queries).
