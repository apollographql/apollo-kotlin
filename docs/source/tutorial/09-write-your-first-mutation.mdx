title: "9. Write your first mutation"
---

In this section, you will write your first mutation to log in to the backend.
A mutation is used to change data on your server. Here the login mutation will create a session based on your email address.

> **Note**: The way you log in to this particular server might differ from the way you log in with your own server. Login is often handled by _middleware_, or a layer totally separate from GraphQL, like [Oauth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth).
> Also note that a typical authentication flow should require a password but for this tutorial, anyone is allowed to book flights with a valid email address!


## Prototype your mutation in GraphQL Playground

Open [GraphQL Playground](https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/) and select the `login` mutation in the docs tab on the right:

This mutation takes a single argument, the `email` address of the person being logged in. Unlike many GraphQL operations that return objects which need to have fields selected, the `login` mutation returns only a single string.

Type the following mutation in GraphiQL:

```graphql
mutation Login($email: String) {
  login(email: $email)
}
```

If you hit Play, you should get a `null` login:

<img alt="Results of not passing email" class="screenshot" src="images/login_mutation_null.png"/>

This is expected, because you didn't specify your email. To do so, add it to the **Query Variables**  in the lower-left pane of GraphQL Playground:

```json:title=(GraphiQL)
{ "email": "me@example.com" }
```

Press the Play button, and you'll get an actual response:

<img alt="Results of passing an actual email" class="screenshot" src="images/login_mutation_email.png"/>

## Add the mutation to the project

Now that your mutation is working, add it to your project. Create a file named `Login.graphql` next to `schema.json` and your other GraphQL files and paste the contents of the mutation:

```graphql:title=app/src/main/graphql/com/example/rocketreserver/Login.graphql
mutation Login($email: String) {
  login(email: $email)
}
```

Build your project to generate the `LoginMutation` class.

## Connect the Submit button to your mutation

Open `LoginFragment.kt` and like you did for the other fragments, override `onViewCreated`. Add a click listener and some checks to verify that the email is a valid email:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LoginFragment.kt
    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)

        binding.submitProgressBar.visibility = View.GONE
        binding.submit.setOnClickListener {
            val email = binding.email.text.toString()
            if (!Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS.matcher(email).matches()) {
                binding.emailLayout.error = getString(R.string.invalid_email)
                return@setOnClickListener
            }
```

From the click listener, display the ProgressBar and execute the query with the email the user just entered:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LoginFragment.kt
            binding.submitProgressBar.visibility = View.VISIBLE
            binding.submit.visibility = View.GONE
            lifecycleScope.launchWhenResumed {
                val response = try {
                    apolloClient.mutate(LoginMutation(email = Input.fromNullable(email))).await()
                } catch (e: Exception) {
                    null
                }
```

Handle errors if needed:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LoginFragment.kt
                val login = response?.data?.login
                if (login == null || response.hasErrors()) {
                    binding.submitProgressBar.visibility = View.GONE
                    binding.submit.visibility = View.VISIBLE
                    return@launchWhenResumed
                }
```

Finally if everything is successful, store the login and go back to the previous screen:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LoginFragment.kt
                User.setToken(requireContext(), login)
                findNavController().popBackStack()
            }
        }
    }
```

`User` is a helper class that saves the token in [EncryptedSharedPreference](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/security/crypto/EncryptedSharedPreferences). This is the reason why this tutorial uses API level 23+. Apollo Android itself supports API levels 19+.

## Test the login

Go the details fragment, click **Book** and in the Login fragment, enter your email and click **Submit**. You now have a token that allows you to authenticate your queries.

In the next section, you will [authenticate your queries](10-authenticate-your-queries).
