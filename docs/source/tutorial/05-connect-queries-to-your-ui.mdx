In this chapter, you are going to display a list of Launch Sites in a [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview).

## Configure LaunchListAdapter

Open `LaunchListAdapter` and add a `launches` property:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LaunchListAdapter.kt
class LaunchListAdapter(
    private val launches: List<LaunchListQuery.Launch>
) : RecyclerView.Adapter<LaunchListAdapter.ViewHolder>() {
```

`LaunchListQuery.Launch` is a typesafe generated model from your LaunchList.graphql query.

## Bind the data to the UI

Use the `launches` property to bind items to your adapter:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LaunchListAdapter.kt
    override fun getItemCount(): Int {
        return launches.size
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        val launch = launches.get(position)
        holder.binding.site.text = launch.site ?: ""
    }
```

## Pass the LaunchListAdapter to the RecyclerView

In **LaunchListFragment.kt**, update what happens within your `lifecycleScope` in `onViewCreated` to create a new Adapter and pass it to your RecyclerView:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LaunchListFragment.kt
        lifecycleScope.launchWhenResumed {
            val response = try {
                apolloClient.query(LaunchListQuery()).execute()
            } catch (e: ApolloException) {
                Log.d("LaunchList", "Failure", e)
                null
            }

            val launches = response?.data?.launches?.launches?.filterNotNull()
            if (launches != null && !response.hasErrors()) {
                val adapter = LaunchListAdapter(launches)
                binding.launches.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(requireContext())
                binding.launches.adapter = adapter
            }
        }
```

## Test your query

Hit the **Run** button. You now have a UI connected to your GraphQL queries ðŸš€

It looks a bit plain, though. Next, you'll [add more info](./06-add-more-info) to the list to make it look nicer!
