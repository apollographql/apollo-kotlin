title: "6. Add more info to the list"
---

In this section, you will use the [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) image-loading library to display a nice patch about the launch. You will also learn about GraphQL arguments.

## Add more info to your query

Go back to `LaunchList.graphql`. Your query is already fetching most of the information you want to display, but it would be nice to display both the name of the mission and an image of the patch.

Looking at the schema in GraphQL Playground, you can see that `Launch` has a property of `mission`, which allows you to get details of the mission. A mission has both a name and a `missionPatch` property, and the `missionPatch` can optionally take a parameter to specify the desired image size.

Because loading a RecyclerView with large images can impact performance, ask for the name and a `SMALL` mission patch. Update your query to look like the following:

```graphql:title=app/src/main/graphql/com/example/rocketreserver/LaunchList.graphql
query LaunchList {
  launches {
    hasMore
    cursor
    launches {
      id
      site
      mission {
        name
        missionPatch(size: SMALL)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When you recompile, if you look in `LaunchListQuery.kt`, you'll see a new nested type, `Mission`, with the two properties you requested.

Any GraphQL field can take arguments like `missionPatch` above, and arguments can be of scalar or complex types. In this case, `SMALL` is an enum in the GraphQL schema. It can take a finite list of values. If you look at the Docs pane in GraphQL Playground, you will see that size is an argument of type `PatchSize` that can only take two values: `SMALL` and `LARGE`

## Bind the infos

In `LaunchListAdapter.kt`, bind the GraphQL data to the missionName and missionPatch Views using Coil:

```kotlin:title=app/src/main/java/com/example/rocketreserver/LaunchListAdapter.kt
    override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        val launch = launches.get(position)
        holder.binding.site.text = launch.site ?: ""
        holder.binding.missionName.text = launch.mission?.name
        holder.binding.missionPatch.load(launch.mission?.missionPatch) {
            placeholder(R.drawable.ic_placeholder)
        }
    }
```

## Test your query

Build and run the application, and you will see all the information for current launches.

<img src="images/list_with_mission.png" alt="Final launch list" class="screenshot" width="300"/>

If you scroll down, you'll see the list includes only about 20 launches. This is because the list of launches is **paginated**, and you've only fetched the first page.

Next, you will [use a cursor-based loading system to load the entire list of launches](./07-paginate-results/).
