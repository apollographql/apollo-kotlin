title: Data builders (experimental)
---

> ⚠️ **Data builders are experimental and subject to change.** If you have feedback on them, please let us know via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug&template=bug_report.md&title=[Test%20Builders]) or in the [Kotlin Slack community](https://slack.kotl.in/).

Apollo Kotlin generates models for your operations and parsers that create instances of these models from your network responses. Sometimes though, during tests or in other occasions, it is useful to instantiate models manually with known values. Doing so is not as straightforward as it may seem, especially when fragments are used. Creating `operationBased` models requires instantiating every fragment as well as choosing an appropriate `__typename` for each composite type. Data builders make this easier by providing builders that match the structure of the Json document.

__Note: previous versions of Apollo Kotlin used data builders. Data builders are a simpler version of test builders that also plays nicer with custom scalars. If you're looking for the test builders documentation, it's still available [here](./test-builders).__

## Enabling data builders

To enable data, set the `generateDataBuilders` option to `true`:

```kotlin title="build.gradle[.kts]"
apollo {
  // ...

  // Enable data builder generation
  generateDataBuilders.set(true)
}
```

This generates a builder for each composite type in your schema as well as a helper `Data {}` function for each of your operations.

## Example usage

Let's say we're building a test that uses a mocked result of the following query:

```graphql
query HeroForEpisode($ep: Episode!) {
  hero(episode: $ep) {
    firstName
    lastName
    age
    
    ship {
      model
      speed
    }

    friends {
      firstName
      lastName
    }

    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }

    ... on Human {
      height
    }
  }
}
```

Here's how we can use the corresponding data builder for that mocked result:

```kotlin
@Test
fun test() {
  val data = HeroForEpisodeQuery.Data {
    // Set values for particular fields of the query
    hero = buildHuman {
      firstName = "John"
      age = 42
      friends = listOf(
        buildHuman {
          firstName = "Jane"
        }, 
        buildHuman {
          lastName = "Doe"
        }
      )
      ship = buildStarship {
        model = "X-Wing"
      }
    }
  }

  assertEquals("John", data.hero.firstName)
  assertEquals(42, data.hero.age)
}
```

In this example, the `hero` field is a `Human` object with specified values for `firstName` and `age`. The values for `lastName`and `height` are automatically populated with mock values.
Similarly, values for the ship's speed, the 1st friend's last name and 2nd friend's first name are automatically populated.

> You can replace `buildHuman` above with `buildDroid` to create a `Droid` object instead.

## Configuring default field values

To assign default values to fields, data builders use an implementation of the `FakeResolver` interface. By default, they use an instance of `DefaultFakeResolver`.

The `DefaultFakeResolver` gives each `String` field the field's name as its default value, and it increments a counter as it assigns default values for `Int` fields. It defines similar default behavior for other types.

You can create your _own_ `FakeResolver` implementation (optionally delegating to `DefaultTestResolver` for a head start). You then pass this implementation as a parameter to the `Data` function, like so:

```kotlin {6}
// A TestResolver implementation that assigns -1 to all Int fields
class MyFakeResolver : FakeResolver {
  private val delegate = DefaultFakeResolver(__Schema.all)
  
  override fun resolveLeaf(context: FakeResolverContext): Any {
    return when (context.mergedField.type.leafType().name) {
      "Int" -> -1 // Always use -1 for Ints
      else -> delegate.resolveLeaf(context) 
    }
  }

  override fun resolveListSize(context: FakeResolverContext): Int {
    // Delegate to the default behaviour
    return delegate.resolveListSize(context)
  }

  override fun resolveMaybeNull(context: FakeResolverContext): Boolean {
    // Never 
    return false
  }

  override fun resolveTypename(context: FakeResolverContext): String {
    // Delegate to the default behaviour
    return delegate.resolveTypename(context)
  }
}

@Test
fun test() {
  val data = HeroForEpisodeQuery.Data(resolver = myTestResolver) {
    hero = buildHuman {
      firstName = "John"
    }
  }

  // Unspecified Int field is -1
  assertEquals(-1, data.hero.age)
}
```
