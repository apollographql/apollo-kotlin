title: Test builders (experimental)
---

> ⚠️ Test builders are [response based](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/response-based-codegen#the-responsebased-codegen) and may generate a lot of code. Moving forward, we recommend to use [data builders](./data-builders) instead, which are simpler to use. This page is kept as reference only.

Apollo Kotlin provides **test builders** that enable you to instantiate your GraphQL model classes with default values. Test builders are especially helpful for testing models with a large number of fields or a deeply nested hierarchy. They automatically populate the `__typename` field and deduplicate merged fields whenever possible.

## Enabling test builders

Test builders are _not_ enabled by default, because they aren't useful for every application and they generate additional code. To enable them, set the `generateTestBuilders` option to `true`:

```kotlin title="build.gradle[.kts]"
apollo {
  // ...

  // Enable test builder generation
  generateTestBuilders.set(true)
}
```

This generates a builder DSL for each model used by your operations. These DSLs are based on each model's fields. Using the DSLs, you can set the values of fields you require for a particular test, and mocked values are set automatically for _other_ fields.

## Example usage

Let's say we're building a test that uses a mocked result of the following query:

```graphql
query HeroForEpisode($ep: Episode!) {
  hero(episode: $ep) {
    firstName
    lastName
    age
    
    ship {
      model
      speed
    }

    friends {
      firstName
      lastName
    }

    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }

    ... on Human {
      height
    }
  }
}
```

Here's how we can use the corresponding test builder for that mocked result:

```kotlin
// Import the query's test builder
import com.example.test.HeroForEpisodeQuery_TestBuilder.Data

@Test
fun test() {
  val data = HeroForEpisodeQuery.Data {
    // Set values for particular fields of the query
    hero = humanHero {
      firstName = "John"
      age = 42
      friends = listOf(
        humanFriend {
          firstName = "Jane"
        },
        humanFriend {
          lastName = "Doe"
        }
      )
      ship = ship {
        model = "X-Wing"
      }
    }
  }

  assertEquals("John", data.hero.firstName)
  assertEquals(42, data.hero.age)
}
```

In this example, the `hero` field is a `Human` object with specified values for `firstName` and `age`. The values for `lastName`and `height` are automatically populated with mock values.
Similarly, values for the ship's speed, the 1st friend's last name and 2nd friend's first name are automatically populated.

> You can replace `humanHero` above with `droidHero` to create a `Droid` object instead, or specify `otherHero` to create an object that is neither a `Human` nor a `Droid`.

## Configuring default field values

To assign default values to fields, test builders use an implementation of the `TestResolver` interface. By default, they use an instance of `DefaultTestResolver`.

The `DefaultTestResolver` gives each `String` field the field's name as its default value, and it increments a counter as it assigns default values for `Int` fields. It defines similar default behavior for other types.

You can create your _own_ `TestResolver` implementation (optionally extending `DefaultTestResolver` for a head start). You then pass this implementation as a parameter to the `Data` function, like so:

```kotlin {10}
// A TestResolver implementation that assigns -1 to all Int fields
val myTestResolver = object : DefaultTestResolver() {
  override fun resolveInt(path: List<Any>): Int {
    return -1
  }
}

@Test
fun test() {
  val data = HeroForEpisodeQuery.Data(testResolver = myTestResolver) {
    hero = humanHero {
      firstName = "John"
    }
  }

  // Unspecified Int field is -1
  assertEquals(-1, data.hero.age)
}
```
