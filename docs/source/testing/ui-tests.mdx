title: UI Tests
---

Apollo Kotlin provides a built-in [`IdlingResource`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/test/espresso/IdlingResource) to help you write UI tests with Espresso. The `ApolloIdlingResource` makes sure that your tests wait for your GraphQL queries to terminate before proceeding.

Add the `apollo-idling-resource` dependency:

```kotlin title="build.gradle[.kts]"
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-idling-resource:4.0.0-beta.6")
```

> If you have multiple `ApolloClient`s, you need to create and register a different `ApolloIdlingResource` with a different name for each. Registering multiple `IdlingResource`s with the same name will cause your test suite to crash.

```kotlin
// Create your IdlingResource
val idlingResource = ApolloIdlingResource("apolloIdlingResource")

// Register the idlingResource before running your tests (once per client).
IdlingRegistry.getInstance().register(idlingResource)

// Intruct your ApolloClient to update the IdlingResource
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
  .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
  .idlingResource(idlingResource)
  .build()
```

In the example above, all operations executed by `apolloClient` (except subscriptions, which might run for a long time) will update the `IdlingResource` so that no automatic actions take place while your app is waiting for data.
