title: Apollo Debug Server
---

The [Android Studio plugin](android-studio-plugin) features the normalized cache viewer, a graphical tool to inspect [normalized caches](../caching/normalized-cache).

While it can open databases from the file system or pull them from a connected device or emulator via adb, to be able to inspect _in-memory_ caches, the plugin needs to communicate with a running application.

To make this happen, the Apollo Debug Server is a small library that you can add to your application. It will open a server that the plugin can connect to (via adb) to list and pull caches that your app is using. 

## Installation

Add the `apollo-debug-server` dependency to your project:

```kotlin title="build.gradle[.kts]"
dependencies {
  // ...

  // For security, add the dependency to your debug builds only
  debugImplementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-debug-server:4.0.0-beta.2")
}
```

## Registering your client

Call `ApolloDebugServer.registerClient` to start the server.

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    // ...
    .build()
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) ApolloDebugServer.registerApolloClient(apolloClient)
```

Optionally pass a unique `name` to `registerApolloClient` to distinguish between clients if you have several.

Unregister the client when it's no longer in use:

```kotlin
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) ApolloDebugServer.unregisterApolloClient(apolloClient)
```
