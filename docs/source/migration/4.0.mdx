title: Migrating to Apollo Kotlin 4.0
description: From 3.x
---

<Note>
Version 4 is currently under development and this page itself is a work in progress.
</Note>

Apollo Kotlin 3.0 was a major rewrite of Apollo in Kotlin multiplatform.

Apollo Kotlin 4.0 focuses on tooling, stability and fixing some API regrets that came with 3.x.

Because most of the common APIs stayed the same, we [kept the package name unchanged](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/4710). Apollo Kotlin 4.0 removes some deprecated symbols. We strongly recommend removing deprecated usages before migrating to 4.0.  

If you are using a lib that depends on Apollo Kotlin transitively, you need it to update to 4.x before you can update your own app to 4.0.

## Automatic migration using the Android Studio plugin

Apollo Kotlin 4 ships with a companion [Android Studio plugin that automates most of the migration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/testing/android-studio-plugin#migration-helpers). 

It automates most of the API replacements but cannot deal with behaviour changes like error handling. 

We recommend using the plugin to automate the repetitive tasks but still go through this document for the details. 

## Error handling

> ⚠️ Error handling changes are a behaviour change that is not be detected at compile time. Usages of `execute`, `toFlow` and `watch` must be updated to the new error handling or changed to their v3 compat equivalent.

### Fetch errors do not throw

In Apollo Kotlin 3.x, non-GraphQL errors like network errors, cache misses, and parsing errors were surfaced by throwing exceptions in `ApolloCall.execute()` and in Flows (`ApolloCall.toFlow()`, `ApolloCall.watch()`). This was problematic because it was a difference in how to handle GraphQL errors vs other errors. Moreover, throwing terminates a Flow and consumers would have to handle re-collection.

In Apollo Kotlin 4.0, a new field `ApolloResponse.exception` has been added and these errors are now surfaced by returning (for `execute()`) or emitting (for Flows) an `ApolloResponse` with a non-null `exception` instead of throwing it. 

This allows consumers to handle different kinds of errors at the same place, and it prevents Flows from being terminated. 

Queries and mutations: 

```kotlin
// Replace
try {
  val response = client.query(MyQuery()).execute()
  if (response.hasErrors()) {
    // Handle GraphQL errors
  } else {
    // No errors
    val data = response.data
    // ...
  }
} catch (e: ApolloException) {
  // Handle network error
}

// With
val response = client.query(MyQuery()).execute()
if (response.data != null) {
  // Handle (potentially partial) data
} else {
  // Something wrong happened
  if (response.exception != null) {
    // Handle non-GraphQL errors
  } else {
    // Handle GraphQL errors in response.errors
  }
}
```

Subscriptions:

```kotlin
// Replace
client.subscription(MySubscription()).toFlow().collect { response ->
  if (response.hasErrors()) {
    // Handle GraphQL errors
  }
}.catch { e ->
  // Handle network error
}

// With
client.subscription(MySubscription()).toFlow().collect { response ->
  val data = response.data
  if (data != null) {
    // Handle (potentially partial) data
  } else {
    // Something wrong happened
    if (response.exception != null) {
      // Handle non-GraphQL errors
    } else {
      // Handle GraphQL errors in response.errors
    }
  }
}
```

Note that this is true for all `Flows`, including watchers. If you don't want to receive error responses, filter them out:

```
// Replace
apolloClient.query(query).watch()

// With
apolloClient.query(query).watch().filter { it.exception == null }
```

### ApolloCompositeException is not thrown anymore

When using the cache, Apollo Kotlin 3.x threw `ApolloCompositeException` if no response could be found. For an example, a `CacheFirst` fetch policy would throw `ApolloCompositeException(cacheMissException, apolloNetworkException` if both cache and network failed.

In those cases, Apollo Kotlin 4.0 throws the first exception and adds the second as a suppressed exception:

```kotlin
    // Replace
if (exception is ApolloCompositeException) {
  val cacheMissException = exception.first
  val networkException = exception.second
}

// With
val cacheMissException = exception
val networkException = exception.suppressedExceptions.firstOrNull()
```

### emitCacheMisses(Boolean) is removed

In Apollo Kotlin 3.x, when using the normalized cache, you could set `emitCacheMisses` to `true` to emit cache misses instead of throwing.

In Apollo Kotlin 4.0, this is now the default behavior and `emitCacheMisses` has been removed.

With the `CacheFirst`, `NetworkFirst` and `CacheAndNetwork` policies, cache misses and network errors are now emitted in `ApolloResponse.exception`.

### Migration helpers

To ease the migration from 3.x, drop-in helpers functions are provided that restore the V3 behaviour:

* `ApolloCall.executeV3()`
* `ApolloCall.toFlowV3()`

Those helper functions:
* throw on fetch errors
* make `CacheFirst`, `NetworkFirst` and `CacheAndNetwork` policies ignore fetch errors.
* throw ApolloComposite exception if needed.

Because of the number of different options in 3.x and the complexity of error handling, these functions do not pretend to match 1:1 the V3 behaviour, especially in the advanced cases involving watchers. If you are in one of those cases, we strongly recommend using the 4.0 functions that are easier to reason about.

## Other Apollo Runtime changes

### HTTP headers

In v3, if HTTP headers were set on an `ApolloCall`, they would replace the ones set on `ApolloClient`. In v4 they are added instead by default. To replace them, call `ApolloCall.Builder.ignoreApolloClientHttpHeaders(true)`.

```kotlin
// Replace
val call = client.query(MyQuery())
  .httpHeaders(listOf("key", "value"))
  .execute()

// With
val call = client.query(MyQuery())
  .httpHeaders(listOf("key", "value"))
  .ignoreApolloClientHttpHeaders(true)
  .execute()
```

## Apollo Gradle Plugin

### Multi-module `dependsOn`

In Apollo Kotlin 3, you could depend on an upstream GraphQL module by using the `apolloMetadata` configuration.

In Apollo Kotlin 4, this is now done with the `Service.dependsOn()`. This allows better management of dependencies when multiple services are used as better symmetry with `isADependencyOf` below. 

```kotlin
// feature1/build.gradle.kts

// Replace
dependencies {
  // ...

  // Get the generated schema types (and fragments) from the upstream schema module 
  apolloMetadata(project(":schema"))

  // You also need to declare the schema module as a regular dependency
  implementation(project(":schema"))
}

// With
dependencies {
  // ...
  
  // You still need to declare the schema module as a regular dependency
  implementation(project(":schema"))
}

apollo {
  service("service") {
    // ...

    // Get the generated schema types (and fragments) from the upstream schema module 
    dependsOn(project(":schema"))
  }
}
```

### Auto-detection of used types

In multi-module projects, by default, all the types of an upstream module are generated because there is no way to know in advance what types are going to be used by downstream modules. For large projects this can lead to a lot of unused code and an increased build time.

To avoid this, in v3 you could manually specify which types to generate by using `alwaysGenerateTypesMatching`. In v4 this can now be computed automatically by detecting which types are used by the downstream modules.

To enable this, add the "opposite" link of dependencies with `isADependencyOf()`.

```kotlin
// schema/build.gradle.kts

// Replace
apollo {
  service("service") {
    // ...
    
    // Generate all the types in the schema module
    alwaysGenerateTypesMatching.set(listOf(".*"))

    // Enable generation of metadata for use by downstream modules 
    generateApolloMetadata.set(true)
  }
}

// With
apollo {
  service("service") {
    // ...

    // Enable generation of metadata for use by downstream modules 
    generateApolloMetadata.set(true)

    // Get used types from the downstream module1
    isADependencyOf(project(":feature1"))

    // Get used types from the downstream module2
    isADependencyOf(project(":feature2"))
    
    // ...
  }
}
```

If you were using `apolloUsedCoordinates`, you can also remove it:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  // Remove this 
  apolloUsedCoordinates(project(":feature1"))
}
```

### Custom scalars declaration

`customScalarsMapping` is removed and replaced with `mapScalar()` which makes it easier to map to built-in types and/or provide a compile type adapter for a given type:

```kotlin
// Replace
customScalarsMapping.set(mapOf(
    "Date" to "kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate"
))

// With
mapScalar("Date", "kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate")

// Replace
customScalarsMapping.put("MyLong", "kotlin.Long")

// With
mapScalarToKotlinLong("MyLong")

```

### Misc

* Publishing is no longer configured automatically.
* Because Apollo Kotlin now supports different operation manifest formats, `operationOutput.json` has moved from `"build/generated/operationOutput/apollo/$service/operationOutput.json"` to `"build/generated/manifest/apollo/$service/operationOutput.json"`
* useSchemaPackageNameForFragments is removed

## Apollo Compiler

### "compat" `codegenModels` is removed

The `"compat"` codegen models was provided for compatibility with 2.x and is now removed. `"operationBased"` is more consistent and generates less code:

```kotlin
// Replace
apollo {
  service("service") {
    codegenModels.set("compat")
  }
}

// With
apollo {
  service("service") {
    codegenModels.set("codegenModels")
  }
}
```

In the generated models, inline fragments accessors are prefixed with `on`:

```kotlin
// Replace
data.hero.asDroid

// With
data.hero.onDroid
```

The `fragments` synthetic property is not needed anymore:

```kotlin
// Replace
data.hero.fragments.heroDetails

// With
data.hero.heroDetails
```

Finally some fields that were merged from inline fragments in their parents must now be accessed through the inline fragment:

```kotlin
// Replace
/**
 * {
 *   hero {
 *     # this condition is always true
 *     # allowing to merge the name field
 *     ... on Character {
 *       name
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 */
data.hero.name

// With 
/**
 * name is not marged anymore
 */
data.hero.onCharacter?.name
```
> The [Android Studio plugin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/v4/testing/android-studio-plugin#migration-helpers) provides a compat to operationBased migration tool which automates a lot of these changes.
### Enum class names now have their first letter capitalized

For consistency with other types, GraphQL enums are now capitalized in Kotlin. You can restore the previous behaviour using `@targetName`:

```graphql
# Make sure `someEnum` isn't renamed to `SomeEnum`
enum someEnum @targetName(name: "someEnum"){
  A
  B
}
```

### `__Schema` is in the `schema` subpackage

If using the `generateSchema` option, and to avoid a name clash with the introspection type of the same name, the `__Schema` type is now generated in a `schema` subpackage (instead of `type`) when using the `generateSchema` option:

```kotlin
// Replace
import com.example.type.__Schema

// With
import data.builders.schema.__Schema
```

### KotlinLabs directives are now version 0.2

The embedded [kotlinlabs/0.2](https://specs.apollo.dev/kotlin_labs/v0.2/) directives are now version 0.2.

These are the client directives supported by Apollo Kotlin. They are imported automatically but if you relied on an explicit import for renames or another reason, you'll need to bump the version:

```graphql
# Replace
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/kotlin_labs/v0.1/", import: ["@typePolicy"])

# With
extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/kotlin_labs/v0.2/", import: ["@typePolicy"])
```

This is a backward compatible change.


## Cache

### ApolloStore

In Apollo Kotlin 3.x, most `ApolloStore` functions were marked as `suspend` even though they were not actually suspending and perform the work in the thread they are called from.
In particular, they can be blocking when the underlying cache is doing IO, so calling them from the main thread can lead to ANRs.

In Apollo Kotlin 4.0 this is still the case but the functions are no longer marked as `suspend` to avoid any confusion.

### Configuration order

The normalized cache must be configured before the auto persisted queries, configuring it after will now fail (see https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/4709).

## apollo-ast

The AST classes (`GQLNode` and subclasses) as well as `Introspection` classes are not data classes anymore (see https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/4704/). The class hierarchy has been tweaked so that `GQLNamed`, `GQLDescribed` and `GQLHasDirectives` are more consistently inherited from.

`GQLSelectionSet` and `GQLArguments` are deprecated and removed from `GQLField` and `GQLInlineFragment`. Use `.selections` directly

`GQLInlineFragment.typeCondition` is now nullable to account for inline fragments who inherit their type condition.

`SourceLocation.position` is renamed `SourceLocation.column` and is now 1-indexed. `GQLNode.sourceLocation` is now nullable to account for the cases where the nodes are constructed programmatically.

It is not possible to create a `Schema` from a File or String directly anymore. Instead, create a `GQLDocument` first and convert it to a schema with `toSchema()`.


## Using RxJava artifacts is now an error

The `apollo-rx2-support` and `apollo-rx3-support` artifacts are very thin wrappers around [`kotlinx-coroutines-rx2`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/tree/master/reactive/kotlinx-coroutines-rx2) or [`kotlinx-coroutines-rx3`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/tree/master/reactive/kotlinx-coroutines-rx3) and will be removed in a future version. 

In Apollo Kotlin 4, use `kotlinx-coroutines-rx${version}` instead. Replace the artifact in your build script:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  // Replace
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-rx2-support:$version")
  
  // With
  implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-rx2:$version")
}

```

In your code, use `asFLowable()`:

```kotlin
// Replace
apolloClient.query().rxFlowable()

// With
apolloClient.query().toFlow().asFlowable()

// Replace
apolloClient.query().rxSingle()

// With
apolloClient.query().toFlow().asFlowable().firstOrError()
```

## Example of a migration

If you are looking for inspiration, we updated the [3.x integration tests to use 4.0](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/5418/). If you have an open source project that migrated, feel free to share it and we'll include it here.
