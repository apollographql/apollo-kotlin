title: Migrating to Apollo Kotlin 4.0
description: From 3.x
---

> Note: as version 4 is currently under development, this page is a work in progress.

## Dependencies / compatibility

- Apollo Kotlin 4 now requires the Kotlin Gradle Plugin version 1.6+ (whereas 3.x needed 1.5+).
- Compatibility with non-hierarchical multiplatform projects (`enableCompatibilityMetadataVariant`) has been removed.

## Error handling

### Exception surfacing

In v3, non-GraphQL errors like network errors, cache misses, and WebSocket protocol errors were surfaced by throwing exceptions in `ApolloCall.execute()` and in Flows (`ApolloCall.toFlow()`, `ApolloCall.watch()`). This was not ideal because it was a difference in how to handle GraphQL errors vs other errors. Moreover, throwing terminates a Flow and consumers would have to handle re-collection.

In v4, a field `ApolloResponse.exception` has been added and these errors are now surfaced by returning (for `execute()`) or emitting (for Flows) an `ApolloResponse` with a non null `exception` instead of throwing it. 

In addition to this, GraphQL errors are also surfaced in an `ApolloGraphQLException` set on `exception` (`.errors` still exists for convenience).

This allows consumers to handle different kinds of errors at the same place, and it avoids Flows from being terminated. 

To ease the migration to v4, the v3 behavior can be restored by calling `ApolloClient.Builder.useV3ExceptionHandling(true)`.

```kotlin
// Replace
try {
  val response = client.query(MyQuery()).execute()
  if (response.hasErrors()) {
    // Handle GraphQL errors
  } else {
    // No errors
    val data = response.data
    // ...
  }
} catch (e: ApolloException) {
  // Handle network error
}

// With
val response = client.query(MyQuery()).execute()
val data = response.data
if (data != null) {
  // No errors
  // ...
} else {
  when (response.exception) {
    is ApolloGraphQLException -> {
      // Handle GraphQL errors
    }
    else -> {
      // Handle network error
    }
  }
}

// Replace
client.subscription(MySubscription()).toFlow().collect { response ->
  if (response.hasErrors()) {
    // Handle GraphQL errors
  }
}.catch { e ->
  // Handle network error
}

// With
client.subscription(MySubscription()).toFlow().collect { response ->
  val data = response.data
  if (data != null) {
    // No errors
    // ...
  } else {
    when (response.exception) {
      is ApolloGraphQLException -> {
        // Handle GraphQL errors
      }
      else -> {
        // Handle network error
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Exception folding when using the cache

In v3, when using the normalized cache, you could set `emitCacheMisses` to `true` to emit cache misses instead of throwing.

In v4, this is now the default behavior and `emitCacheMisses` has been removed. 
With the `CacheFirst`, `NetworkFirst` and `CacheAndNetwork` policies, cache misses and network errors are now emitted in `ApolloResponse.exception`.

To ease the migration to v4, the v3 behavior can be restored by calling `ApolloClient.Builder.useV3ExceptionHandling(true)`.

### Exceptions in `watch`

In v3, `ApolloCall.watch()` would accept a `fetchThrows` and `refetchThrows` parameters to control whether to throw cache or network exceptions happening during the initial fetch or subsequent refetches, the default value being `false`.

In v4, these exceptions are now emitted in `ApolloResponse.exception`.

If they are undesirable, ignore them by filtering them out:

```kotlin   
client.query(MyQuery()).watch().filter { it.exception == null }.collect { response ->
  // Handle responses
}
```

## HTTP headers

In v3, if HTTP headers were set on an `ApolloCall`, they would replace the ones set on `ApolloClient`. In v4 they are added instead by default. To replace them, call `ApolloCall.Builder.ignoreApolloClientHttpHeaders(true)`.

```kotlin
// Replace
val call = client.query(MyQuery())
  .httpHeaders(listOf("key", "value"))
  .execute()

// With
val call = client.query(MyQuery())
  .httpHeaders(listOf("key", "value"))
  .ignoreApolloClientHttpHeaders(true)
  .execute()
```

## Multi-module improvements

In a multi-module setup, the syntax for depending on an upstream module (e.g. the schema module) has changed: use `dependsOn` in the `apollo` block instead of `apolloMetadata` in the `dependencies` block.

```kotlin
// feature1/build.gradle.kts

// Replace
dependencies {
  // ...

  // Get the generated schema types (and fragments) from the upstream schema module 
  apolloMetadata(project(":schema"))

  // You also need to declare the schema module as a regular dependency
  implementation(project(":schema"))
}

// With
dependencies {
  // ...
  
  // You still need to declare the schema module as a regular dependency
  implementation(project(":schema"))
}

apollo {
  service("service") {
    // ...

    // Get the generated schema types (and fragments) from the upstream schema module 
    dependsOn(project(":schema"))
  }
}
```

### Auto-detection of used types

In multi-module projects, by default, all the types of an upstream module are generated because there is no way to know in advance what types are going to be used by downstream modules. For large projects this can lead to a lot of unused code and an increased build time.

To avoid this, in v3 you could manually specify which types to generate by using `alwaysGenerateTypesMatching`. In v4 this can now be computed automatically by detecting which types are used by the downstream modules.

To enable this, add the "opposite" link of dependencies with `isADependencyOf()`.

```kotlin
// schema/build.gradle.kts
apollo {
  service("service") {
    // ...

    // Enable generation of metadata for use by downstream modules 
    generateApolloMetadata.set(true)

    // Get used types from the downstream module
    isADependencyOf(project(":feature1"))

    // You can have several downstream modules
    isADependencyOf(project(":feature2"))
  }
}
```

## Code generation

- Enum class names now have their first letter capitalized, as other generated types.
- To avoid a name clash with the introspection type of the same name, the `__Schema` type is now generated in a `schema` subpackage (instead of `type`) when using the `generateSchema` option.
- `addTypename = "ifFragments"` is deprecated as it could lead to cache misses for cache users:

```graphql
{
  node(id: 42) {
    # no fragment here means but we if we don't query __typename, the query below will emit a cache miss 
    title
    price
  }
}

{
  product(id: 42) {
    # __typename is added here automatically
    __typename
    ... on Product {
      title
      price
    }
  }
}
```

Instead, use `"always"` if you're using the cache or `"ifPolymorphic"` else. See [#3965](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/3965) for more details.

## Cache

The normalized cache must be configured before the auto persisted queries, configuring it after will now fail (see https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/4709).

## apollo-ast

The AST classes (`GQLNode` and subclasses) as well as `Introspection` classes are not data classes anymore (see https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/4704/). The class hierarchy has been tweaked so that `GQLNamed`, `GQLDescribed` and `GQLHasDirectives` are more consistently inherited from.

`GQLSelectionSet` and `GQLArguments` are deprecated and removed from `GQLField` and `GQLInlineFragment`. Use `.selections` directly

`GQLInlineFragment.typeCondition` is now nullable to account for inline fragments who inherit their type condition.

`SourceLocation.position` is renamed `SourceLocation.column` and is now 1-indexed. `GQLNode.sourceLocation` is now nullable to account for the cases where the nodes are constructed programmatically.

It is not possible to create a `Schema` from a File or String directly anymore. Instead, create a `GQLDocument` first and convert it to a schema with `toSchema()`.



## Gradle configuration

* Publishing is no longer configured automatically.
* Because Apollo Kotlin now supports different operation manifest formats, `operationOutput.json` has moved from `"build/generated/operationOutput/apollo/$service/operationOutput.json"` to `"build/generated/manifest/apollo/$service/operationOutput.json"`
