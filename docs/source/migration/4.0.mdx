title: Migrating to Apollo Kotlin 4.0
description: From 3.x
---

> Note: this page is a work in progress.

* Requires Kotlin Gradle Plugin 1.6 (from 1.5)
* Dropped `enableCompatibilityMetadataVariant`
* Configuring your cache after enabling APQs will now fail (
  see https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/4709)
* The AST classes (GQLNode and subclasses) as well as Introspection classes are not data classes anymore (see https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/pull/4704/)
* Enums are now capitalized
* Using the `apolloMetadata` configuration is now an error
* Publishing is not configured automatically any more
* To avoid a name clash with the introspection type of the same name, the `__Schema` type is now generated in a `schema`
  subpackage (instead of `type`) when using the `generateSchema` option.

## Error handling

### Exception surfacing

In v3, non-GraphQL errors like network errors, cache misses, and WebSocket protocol errors were surfaced by throwing exceptions in `ApolloCall.execute()` and in Flows (`ApolloCall.toFlow()`, `ApolloCall.watch()`). This was not ideal because it was a difference in how to handle GraphQL errors vs other errors. Moreover, throwing terminates a Flow and consumers would have to handle re-collection.

In v4, a field `ApolloResponse.exception` has been added and these errors are now surfaced by returning (for `execute()`) or emitting (for Flows) an `ApolloResponse` with a non null `exception` instead of throwing it. 

In addition to this, GraphQL errors are also surfaced in an `ApolloGraphQLException` set on `exception` (`.errors` still exists for convenience).

This allows consumers to handle different kinds of errors at the same place, and it avoids Flows from being terminated. 

To ease the migration to v4, the v3 behavior can be restored by calling `ApolloClient.Builder.useV3ExceptionHandling(true)`.

```kotlin
// Replace
try {
  val response = client.query(MyQuery()).execute()
  if (response.hasErrors()) {
    // Handle GraphQL errors
  } else {
    // No errors
    val data = response.data
    // ...
  }
} catch (e: ApolloException) {
  // Handle network error
}

// With
val response = client.query(MyQuery()).execute()
val data = response.data
if (data != null) {
  // No errors
  // ...
} else {
  when (response.exception) {
    is ApolloGraphQLException -> {
      // Handle GraphQL errors
    }
    else -> {
      // Handle network error
    }
  }
}

// Replace
client.subscription(MySubscription()).toFlow().collect { response ->
  if (response.hasErrors()) {
    // Handle GraphQL errors
  }
}.catch { e ->
  // Handle network error
}

// With
client.subscription(MySubscription()).toFlow().collect { response ->
  val data = response.data
  if (data != null) {
    // No errors
    // ...
  } else {
    when (response.exception) {
      is ApolloGraphQLException -> {
        // Handle GraphQL errors
      }
      else -> {
        // Handle network error
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Exception folding when using the cache

In v3, when using the normalized cache, you could set `emitCacheMisses` to `true` to emit cache misses instead of throwing.

In v4, this is now the default behavior and `emitCacheMisses` has been removed. 
With the `CacheFirst`, `NetworkFirst` and `CacheAndNetwork` policies, cache misses and network errors are now emitted in `ApolloResponse.exception`.

To ease the migration to v4, the v3 behavior can be restored by calling `ApolloClient.Builder.useV3ExceptionHandling(true)`.

### Exceptions in `watch`

In v3, `ApolloCall.watch()` would accept a `fetchThrows` and `refetchThrows` parameters to control whether to throw cache or network exceptions happening during the initial fetch or subsequent refetches, the default value being `false`.

In v4, these exceptions are now emitted in `ApolloResponse.exception`.

If they are undesirable, ignore them by filtering them out:

```kotlin   
client.query(MyQuery()).watch().filter { it.exception == null }.collect { response ->
  // Handle responses
}
```

## HTTP headers

In v3, if HTTP headers were set on an `ApolloCall`, they would replace the ones set on `ApolloClient`. In v4 they are added instead by default. To replace them, call `ApolloCall.Builder.ignoreApolloClientHeaders(true)`.

```kotlin
// Replace
val call = client.query(MyQuery())
  .httpHeaders(listOf("key", "value"))
  .execute()

// With
val call = client.query(MyQuery())
  .httpHeaders(listOf("key", "value"))
  .ignoreApolloClientHeaders(true)
  .execute()
```
