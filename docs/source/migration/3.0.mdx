Apollo Android 3.0 rewrites most of Apollo Android's internals in Kotlin. Among other improvements, it features:

* Kotlin-first, coroutine-based APIs
* A unified runtime for both JVM and multiplatform
* Declarative cache, `@nonnull` client directives, performance improvements and more...

Although most of the library's concepts are the same, many APIs have changed to work better in Kotlin.

This page describes the most important changes, along with how to migrate an existing project from Apollo Android 2.x to Apollo Android 3.x.

## Package name / group id / plugin id

Apollo Android 3.0 uses a new identifier for its package name, Gradle plugin id, and maven group id: **`com.apollographql.apollo3`**.

This change avoids dependency conflicts as encouraged in [Java Interoperability Policy for Major Version Updates](https://jakewharton.com/java-interoperability-policy-for-major-version-updates/). It also allows to run version 2 and version 3 side by side if needed.

> In most cases, you can update the identifier throughout your project by performing a find-and-replace and replapcing `com.apollographql.apollo` with `com.apollographql.apollo3`.

#### Group id

The maven group id used to identify Apollo Android 3.0 [artifacts](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/apollographql/apollo3/) is `com.apollographql.apollo3`:

```kotlin
// Replace:
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-runtime:$version")
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-api:$version")

// With:
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime:$version")
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-api:$version")
```

#### Gradle plugin id

The Apollo Android 3.0 Gradle plugin id is `com.apollographql.apollo3`:

```kotlin
// Replace:
plugins {
  id("com.apollographql.apollo").version("$version")
}

// With:
plugins {
  id("com.apollographql.apollo3").version("$version")
}
```

#### Package name

All Apollo Android 3.0 classes are imported from the `com.apollographql.apollo3` package:

```kotlin
// Replace:
import com.apollographql.apollo.ApolloClient

// With:
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
```

## Gradle configuration

### `generateKotlinModels`

Apollo Android 3.0 generates Kotlin models by default. You can safely remove this behavior:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // remove this
  generateKotlinModels.set(true)
}
```

### `apollo-coroutines-support` is removed

Apollo Android 3.x is kotlin first and exposes suspend functions by default. `apollo-coroutines-support` is not needed anymore:

```kotlin
// Remove:
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-coroutines-support:$version")
```

### `apollo-android-support` is removed

Apollo Android 2.x publishes a small artifact to support running callbacks on a specific Handler and write logs to logcat.

Apollo Android 3.x uses coroutines and exposes more information in its API so that logging hooks shouldn't be required any more. If you were using logs to get information about cache hits/misses, you can now catch `CacheMissException` to get the same information in a more strongly typed way.


```kotlin
// Remove:
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-android-support:$version")
```

### `customScalarMappings`

In order to make it explicit that custom mappings only apply to custom scalars and not arbitrary types, `customTypeMapping` has been renamed to `customScalarsMapping`

<MultiCodeBlock>

```groovy
apollo {
  // Replace
  customTypeMapping = [
    "GeoPoint" : "com.example.GeoPoint"
  ]
  // With
  customScalarsMapping = [
    "GeoPoint" : "com.example.GeoPoint"
  ]
}
```

```kotlin
apollo {
  // Replace
  customTypeMapping.set(mapOf(
    "GeoPoint" to "com.example.GeoPoint"
  ))
  // With
  customScalarsMapping.set(mapOf(
    "GeoPoint" to "com.example.GeoPoint"
  ))
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

### Specifying schema and .graphql files

Apollo Android 2.x has a complex logic to determine what files to use as input. For example, it resolves `sourceFolder` relative to multiple Android variants or kotlin sourceSets, tries to get the .graphql files from the schema location and the other way around too. This logic works in most cases but makes troubleshooting more complicated, especially in more complex scenarios. Also, this runs the GraphQL compiler multiple times for different source sets even if in the vast majority of cases, the same .graphql files are used.

Apollo Android 3.x simplifies this setup. Each `Service` is exactly one compilation. For Android projects, GraphQL classes are generated once and then added to all variants.

If you previously used `graphqlSourceDirectorySet` to explicitly specify the location of GraphQL files, you can now use `srcDir`:


```kotlin
apollo {
  // Replace
  graphqlSourceDirectorySet.srcDirs += "shared/graphql"

  // With
  srcDir("shared/graphql")
  
  // Replace
  graphqlSourceDirectorySet.include("**/*.graphql")
  graphqlSourceDirectorySet.exclude("**/schema.graphql")

  // With
  include.add("**/*.graphql")
  exclude.add("**/schema.graphql")
}
```

If you were relying on the schema location to automatically lookup the .graphql files, you should also now add `srcDir()` to explicitly set the location of your .graphql files:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // Replace
  schemaFile.set(file("src/main/graphql-api/schema.graphqls"))

  // With
  // Keep schemaFile
  schemaFile.set(file("src/main/graphql-api/schema.graphqls"))
  // explicitly set srcDir
  srcDir(file("src/main/graphql-api/"))
}
```

If you need different GraphQL operations for different variants, you can create multiple services for each Android variant using [apollo.createAllAndroidVariantServices](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-android/kdoc/apollo-gradle-plugin/com.apollographql.apollo3.gradle.api/-apollo-extension/create-all-android-variant-services.html).


### Package name

Apollo Android 2.x computes its target package name based on a combination of the path of GraphQL operation and schema files, and the `packageName` and `rootPackageName` options. While this is very flexible, it's not easy to anticipate the final package name that is going to be used.

Apollo Android 3.x uses a flat package name by default using the `packageName` option:

```kotlin
apollo {
  packageName.set("com.example")
}
```

The generated classes will be:

```
- com.example.SomeQuery
- com.example.fragment.SomeFragment
- com.example.type.SomeInputObject
- com.example.type.SomeEnum
- com.example.type.Types // types is a slimmed down version of the schema
```

If you need different package names for different operation folders, you can fallback to the 2.x behaviour with:

```kotlin
apollo {
  packageNamesFromFilePaths("$rootPackageName")
}
```

For even more control, you can also define your own `PackageNameGenerator`:

```kotlin
apollo {
  packageNameGenerator.set(customPackageNameGenerator)
}
```

## Builders

On Apollo Android 2.x you would use the `ApolloClient.builder()` method to instantiate a new Builder. With 3.x, use the `ApolloClient.Builder()` constructor instead (notice the capital `B`).

```kotlin
// Replace
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl(serverUrl)
    // ...other Builder methods
    .build()

// With
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl(serverUrl)
    // ...other Builder methods
    .build()
```

Using a custom HttpClient on Apollo Android 3.x is different from doing so on 2.x due to the more platform-agnostic nature of the API:

```kotlin
// Replace
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl(serverUrl)
    .okHttpClient(okHttpClient)
    .build()

// With
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .networkTransport(
        HttpNetworkTransport(
            serverUrl = serverUrl,
            engine = DefaultHttpEngine(okHttpClient)
        )
    )
    .build()
```

## Coroutines APIs

Apollo Android 2.x has callback APIs that can become verbose and require explicitly handling cancellation.

Apollo Android 3.x exposes more concise coroutines APIs that handle cancellation automatically through the coroutine scope.

```kotlin
// Replace
apolloClient.query(query).await()
// With
apolloClient.query(query)

// Replace
apolloClient.subscribe(subscription).toFlow()
// With
apolloClient.subscribe(subscription)
```

## Custom Scalar adapters

Apollo Android 3 ships an optional [apollo-adapters](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-android/kdoc/apollo-adapters/com.apollographql.apollo3.adapter/index.html) artifact that includes adapters for common scalar types like:

* `InstantAdapter` for `kotlinx.datetime.Instant` ISO8601 dates
* `LocalDateAdapter` for `kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate` ISO8601 dates
* `DateAdapter` for `java.util.Date` ISO8601 dates
* `LongAdapter` for `java.lang.Long`
* `BigDecimalAdapter` for a MPP `BigDecimal` class holding big decimal values

To include them, add this dependency to your gradle file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-adapters:$version")
}
```

If the above adapters do not fit your needs or if you need to customize them, you can use the Custom Scalar adapters API.

The Custom Scalar adapters API has changed a lot to support nullable and absent values as well as streaming use cases. Apollo Android 3 makes it possible to read/write custom scalars without having to create an intermediate copy in memory. To do this, it uses the same `Adapter` API that is used internally to parse the models:

```kotlin
// Replace
val dateAdapter = object : CustomTypeAdapter<Date> {
  override fun decode(value: CustomTypeValue<*>): Date {
    return DATE_FORMAT.parse(value.value.toString())
  }

  override fun encode(value: Date): CustomTypeValue<*> {
    return GraphQLString(DATE_FORMAT.format(value))
  }
}

// With
val dateAdapter = object : Adapter<Date> {
  override fun fromJson(reader: JsonReader, customScalarAdapters: CustomScalarAdapters): Date {
    return DATE_FORMAT.parse(reader.nextString())
  }

  override fun toJson(writer: JsonWriter, customScalarAdapters: CustomScalarAdapters, value: Date) {
    writer.value(DATE_FORMAT.format(value))
  }
}
```

The `JsonReader` and `JsonWriter` APIs are similar to the ones you can find in [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) and are stateful APIs that require you to handle the Json properties in the order they arrive from the Json stream. If you prefer, you can also buffer the Json into an untyped `Any?` value that represent the json and use `AnyAdapter` to decode/encode it:

```kotlin
// Use AnyAdapter to convert between JsonReader/JsonWriter and a Kotlin Any value
val geoPointAdapter = object : Adapter<GeoPoint> {
  override fun fromJson(reader: JsonReader, customScalarAdapters: CustomScalarAdapters): GeoPoint {
    val map = AnyAdapter.fromJson(reader) as Map<String, Double>
    return GeoPoint(map["latitude"] as Double, map["longitude"] as Double)
  }

  override fun toJson(writer: JsonWriter, customScalarAdapters: CustomScalarAdapters, value: GeoPoint) {
    val map = mapOf(
        "latitude" to value.latitude,
        "longitude" to value.longitude
    )
    AnyAdapter.toJson(writer, map)
  }
}
```

After you define your adapters, you need to register them with your `ApolloClient` instance. To do so, call `ApolloClient.Builder.addCustomScalarAdapter` once for each adapter:

```kotlin
// Replace
val apolloClient = apolloClientBuilder.addCustomTypeAdapter(CustomType.DATE, dateAdapter).build()

// With
val apolloClient = apolloClientBuilder.addCustomScalarAdapter(Date.type, dateAdapter).build()
```

This method takes a type-safe generated class from `Types`, along with its corresponding adapter.


## Caching

### Normalized cache

The Apollo Android 2.x runtime has a dependency on the normalized cache APIs, and it's possible to call cache methods even if no cache implementation is in the classpath.

The Apollo Android 3.x runtime is more modular and doesn't know anything about normalized cache by default. To add normalized cache support, include `apollo-normalized-cache` in the classpath:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  // Replace
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-normalized-cache") // for memory cache
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite") // for SQL cache

  // With
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-normalized-cache") // for memory cache
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite") // for SQL cache
}
```

```kotlin
// Replace
val cacheFactory = LruNormalizedCacheFactory(
                     EvictionPolicy.builder().maxSizeBytes(10 * 1024 * 1024).build()
                   )

val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(cacheFactory)
  .build()

// With
val cacheFactory = MemoryCacheFactory(maxSizeBytes = 10 * 1024 * 1024)
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(cacheFactory)
  .build()
```

Configuring the fetch policy is now made on an `ApolloRequest` instance:

```kotlin
// Replace
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
                      .toBuilder()
                      .responseFetcher(ApolloResponseFetchers.CACHE_FIRST)
                      .build()
                      .await()

// With
val request = ApolloRequest.Builder(query).fetchPolicy(CacheFirst).build()
val response = apolloClient.query(request)
```

### HTTP cache

Similarly, the HTTP cache is configurable through extension functions:

```kotlin
// Replace
val cacheStore = DiskLruHttpCacheStore()
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("/")
    .httpCache(ApolloHttpCache(cacheStore))
    .build()

// With
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .httpCache(File(cacheDir, "apolloCache"), 1024 * 1024)
    .build()
```

Configuring the HTTP fetch policy is now made on an `ApolloRequest` instance:

```kotlin
// Replace
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
                      .toBuilder()
                      .httpCachePolicy(HttpCachePolicy.CACHE_FIRST)
                      .build()
                      .await()

// With
val request = ApolloRequest.Builder(query).httpFetchPolicy(CacheFirst).build()
val response = apolloClient.query(request)
```

### `CacheKeyResolver`

The `CacheKeyResolver` API has been split in two different APIs:

* `ObjectIdGenerator.cacheKeyForObject`
  * takes Json data as input and returns a unique id for an object.
  * is used **after** a network request
  * is used during normalization when **writing** to the cache
* `CacheKeyResolver.cacheKeyForField`
  * takes a GraphQL field and operation variables as input and generates an id for this field
  * is used **before** a network request
  * is used when **reading** the cache

Previously, both methods were in `CacheResolver` even if under the hood, the code path were very different. By separating them, it makes it explicit and also makes it possible to only implement one of them.

At a high level,
* `fromFieldRecordSet` is renamed to `ObjectIdGenerator.cacheKeyForObject`.
* `fromFieldArguments` is renamed to `CacheKeyResolver.cacheKeyForField`.
* The `CacheKey` return value is now nullable, and `CacheKey.NONE` is replaced with `null`.

```kotlin
// Replace
val resolver: CacheKeyResolver = object : CacheKeyResolver() {
  override fun fromFieldRecordSet(field: ResponseField, recordSet: Map<String, Any>): CacheKey {
    return CacheKey.from(recordSet["id"] as String)
  }
  override fun fromFieldArguments(field: ResponseField, variables: Operation.Variables): CacheKey {
    return CacheKey.from(field.resolveArgument("id", variables) as String)
  }
}
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .normalizedCache(cacheFactory, resolver)
    .build()


// With
val objectIdGenerator = object : ObjectIdGenerator {
  override fun cacheKeyForObject(obj: Map<String, Any?>, context: ObjectIdGeneratorContext): CacheKey? {
    return obj["id"]?.toString()?.let { CacheKey(it) } ?: TypePolicyObjectIdGenerator.cacheKeyForObject(obj, context)
  }
}

val cacheKeyResolver = object : CacheKeyResolver() {
  override fun cacheKeyForField(field: CompiledField, variables: Executable.Variables): CacheKey? {
    return (field.resolveArgument("id", variables) as String?)?.let { CacheKey(it) }
  }
}

val apolloClient = ApolloClient("https://").withNormalizedCache(
    normalizedCacheFactory = cacheFactory,
    objectIdGenerator = objectIdGenerator,
    cacheResolver = cacheKeyResolver
)
```

## Optional values

### The `Optional` class

Apollo Android distinguishes between `null` values and absent values.

Apollo Android 2.x uses `Input` to represent optional (maybe nullable) values for input types.

Apollo Android 3.x uses `Optional` instead so that later it can potentially be used in places _besides_ input types (for example, fields could be made optional with an [`@optional`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/blob/5c1ff82ccaded93ae7126cedc6d7835e63fed75a/apollo-compiler/src/main/resources/apollo.graphqls#L6) directive).

`Optional` is a sealed class, so `when` statements don't need an `else` branch.


```kotlin
// Replace
Input.fromNullable(value)
// With
Optional.Present(value)

// Replace
Input.absent()
// With
Optional.Absent

// Replace
Input.optional(value)
// With
Optional.presentIfNotNull(value)
```

### Non-optional variables by default

By default, Apollo Android 3.x represents operation variables that _don't_ have a default value as non-optional Kotlin constructor parameters.

Given the following query:

```graphql
query GetHero($id: String) {
  hero(id: $id)
}
```

Apollo Android generates:

```kotlin
// 2.x
class GetHero(val id: Input<String?> = Input.absent())

// 3.x
class GetHero(val id: String?)
```

By default, the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Coercing-Variable-Values) treats nullable variables as optional, so it's valid to omit them at runtime. In practice, however, this is rarely used and makes the operation's declaration verbose.

Apollo Android 3.x removes the `Optional` wrapper so that it's more straightforward to construct a query with nullable variables.

> This new behavior applies _only_ to variables. Fields of input objects still use `Optional`, because it's common to omit particular input fields.

If you want to be able to omit a variable, you can opt in to the `Optional` wrapper with the `@optional` directive:

```graphql
query GetHero($id: String @optional) {
  hero(id: $id)
}
```

## Enums

By default, Apollo Android 2.x generates GraphQL enums as Kotlin enums, with an option to generate them as sealed classes to access the raw name of the enum.

Apollo Android 3.x drops Kotlin enums and always generates sealed classes. In addition, Apollo Android 3.x uses the same case for enum names as their GraphQL definition, instead of converting them to uppercase. This enables you to define different enums with different cases, which is valid in GraphQL.
