title: Migrating to Apollo Kotlin 3.0
description: From 2.x
---

Apollo Kotlin 3.0 rewrites most of Apollo Android's internals in Kotlin. Among other improvements, it features:

* Kotlin-first, coroutine-based APIs
* A unified runtime for both JVM and multiplatform
* Declarative cache, `@nonnull` client directives, performance improvements and more...

Although most of the library's concepts are the same, many APIs have changed to work better in Kotlin.

This page describes the most important changes, along with how to migrate an existing project from Apollo Android 2.x to Apollo Kotlin 3.x.

Feel free to ask questions by either [opening an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/issues), [joining the community](http://community.apollographql.com/new-topic?category=Help&tags=mobile,client) or [stopping by our channel in the KotlinLang Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T09229ZC6/C01A6KM1SBZ)(get your invite [here](https://slack.kotl.in/)).

## The quick route ðŸš€

Apollo Kotlin 3 provides a few helpers and compatibility modes to ease the migration from 2.x. To quickly reach a working state, follow the steps below.
Once you have a working app, we strongly recommend to migrate to idiomatic Apollo Kotlin 3 as described in the [All details](#all-details) section below. The compatibility helpers will be removed in a future version of Apollo Kotlin

1. Update your dependencies and imports (`com.apollographql.apollo` â†’ `com.apollographql.apollo3`, see [section below](#package-name--group-id--plugin-id)).
  Remove `apollo-coroutines-support` and `apollo-android-support` if applicable.
2. Gradle configuration:
```kotlin
apollo {
  // Remove this
  generateKotlinModels.set(true)

  // Add this
  useVersion2Compat()
}
```
3. Apollo Client configuration:
```kotlin
val client = ApolloClient.builder()
  .serverUrl(...)

  // Replace:
  .addCustomTypeAdapter(CustomType.YOURTYPE, ...)

  // With:
  .addCustomScalarAdapter(YourType.type, ...)

  .build()

```

## All details

### Package name / group id / plugin id

Apollo Kotlin 3.0 uses a new identifier for its package name, Gradle plugin id, and maven group id: **`com.apollographql.apollo3`**.

This change avoids dependency conflicts as encouraged in [Java Interoperability Policy for Major Version Updates](https://jakewharton.com/java-interoperability-policy-for-major-version-updates/). It also allows to run version 2 and version 3 side by side if needed.

> In most cases, you can update the identifier throughout your project by performing a find-and-replace and replacing `com.apollographql.apollo` with `com.apollographql.apollo3`.

#### Group id

The maven group id used to identify Apollo Kotlin 3.0 [artifacts](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/apollographql/apollo3/) is `com.apollographql.apollo3`:

```kotlin
// Replace:
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-runtime:$version")
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-api:$version")

// With:
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime:$version")
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-api:$version")
```

#### Gradle plugin id

The Apollo Kotlin 3.0 Gradle plugin id is `com.apollographql.apollo3`:

```kotlin
// Replace:
plugins {
  id("com.apollographql.apollo") version "$version"
}

// With:
plugins {
  id("com.apollographql.apollo3") version "$version"
}
```

#### Package name

All Apollo Kotlin 3.0 classes are imported from the `com.apollographql.apollo3` package:

```kotlin
// Replace:
import com.apollographql.apollo.ApolloClient

// With:
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
```

### Gradle configuration

#### Task names

The Gradle plugin has significantly changed in Apollo Kotlin 3.x to only generate model once for all Android variants. If you were previously using task names like "generateDebugServiceApolloSources", you can now drop the Android variant name and use "generateServiceApolloSources" instead.

#### `generateKotlinModels`

If you are using the Kotlin Gradle Plugin, Apollo Kotlin 3.0 generates Kotlin models by default. You can safely remove this behavior:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // remove this
  generateKotlinModels.set(true)
}
```

#### `apollo-coroutines-support` is removed

Apollo Kotlin 3.x is kotlin first and exposes suspend functions by default. `apollo-coroutines-support` is not needed anymore:

```kotlin
// Remove:
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-coroutines-support:$version")
```

#### `apollo-android-support` is removed

Apollo Android 2.x publishes a small artifact to support running callbacks on a specific Handler and write logs to logcat.

Apollo Kotlin 3.x uses coroutines and exposes more information in its API so that logging hooks shouldn't be required any more. If you were using logs to get information about cache hits/misses, you can now catch `CacheMissException` to get the same information in a more strongly typed way.


```kotlin
// Remove:
implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-android-support:$version")
```

#### Scalar mapping

In order to make it explicit that custom mappings only apply to scalars and not arbitrary types, `customTypeMapping` has been replaced by the `mapScalar` method.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```groovy
apollo {
  // Replace
  customTypeMapping = [
    "GeoPoint" : "com.example.GeoPoint",
    "Date" : "com.example.MyDate"
  ]
  // With
  mapScalar("GeoPoint", "com.example.GeoPoint")
  mapScalar("Date", "com.example.MyDate")
}
```

```kotlin
apollo {
  // Replace
  customTypeMapping.set(mapOf(
    "GeoPoint" to "com.example.GeoPoint",
    "Date" to "com.example.MyDate"
  ))
  // With
  mapScalar("GeoPoint", "com.example.GeoPoint")
  mapScalar("Date", "com.example.MyDate")
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

#### Specifying schema and .graphql files

Apollo Android 2.x has a complex logic to determine what files to use as input. For example, it resolves `sourceFolder` relative to multiple Android variants or kotlin sourceSets, tries to get the .graphql files from the schema location and the other way around too. This logic works in most cases but makes troubleshooting more complicated, especially in more complex scenarios. Also, this runs the GraphQL compiler multiple times for different source sets even if in the vast majority of cases, the same .graphql files are used.

Apollo Kotlin 3.x simplifies this setup. Each `Service` is exactly one compilation. For Android projects, GraphQL classes are generated once and then added to all variants.

If you previously used `graphqlSourceDirectorySet` to explicitly specify the location of GraphQL files, you can now use `srcDir`:


```kotlin
apollo {
  // Replace
  graphqlSourceDirectorySet.srcDirs += "shared/graphql"

  // With
  srcDir("shared/graphql")

  // Replace
  graphqlSourceDirectorySet.include("**/*.graphql")
  graphqlSourceDirectorySet.exclude("**/schema.graphql")

  // With
  includes.add("**/*.graphql")
  excludes.add("**/schema.graphql")
}
```

If you were relying on the schema location to automatically lookup the .graphql files, you should also now add `srcDir()` to explicitly set the location of your .graphql files:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // Replace
  schemaFile.set(file("src/main/graphql-api/schema.graphqls"))

  // With
  // Keep schemaFile
  schemaFile.set(file("src/main/graphql-api/schema.graphqls"))
  // explicitly set srcDir
  srcDir(file("src/main/graphql-api/"))
}
```

If you need different GraphQL operations for different variants, you can create multiple services for each Android variant using [apollo.createAllAndroidVariantServices](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-kotlin/kdoc/apollo-gradle-plugin-external/com.apollographql.apollo3.gradle.api/-apollo-extension/create-all-android-variant-services.html).


#### Package name

Apollo Android 2.x computes its target package name based on a combination of the path of GraphQL operation and schema files, and the `packageName` and `rootPackageName` options. While this is very flexible, it's not easy to anticipate the final package name that is going to be used.

Apollo Kotlin 3.x uses a flat package name by default using the `packageName` option:

```kotlin
apollo {
  packageName.set("com.example")
}
```

The generated classes will be:

```
- com.example.SomeQuery
- com.example.fragment.SomeFragment
- com.example.type.SomeInputObject
- com.example.type.SomeEnum
- com.example.type.Types // types is a slimmed down version of the schema
```

If you need different package names for different operation folders, you can fallback to the 2.x behaviour with:

```kotlin
apollo {
  packageNamesFromFilePaths("$rootPackageName")
  # If using version 3.1.0+, you will also need useSchemaPackageNameForFragments
  useSchemaPackageNameForFragments.set(true)
}
```

For even more control, you can also define your own `PackageNameGenerator`:

```kotlin
apollo {
  packageNameGenerator.set(customPackageNameGenerator)
}
```

### Builders

On Apollo Android 2.x you would use the `ApolloClient.builder()` method to instantiate a new Builder. With 3.x, use the `ApolloClient.Builder()` constructor instead (notice the capital `B`).

```kotlin
// Replace
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl(serverUrl)
    // ...other Builder methods
    .build()

// With
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl(serverUrl)
        // ...other Builder methods
        .build()
```

### Operation APIs

Apollo Android 2.x has callback APIs that can become verbose and require explicitly handling cancellation.

Apollo Kotlin 3.x exposes more concise coroutines APIs that handle cancellation automatically through the coroutine
scope.

Also, `mutate` has been renamed to `mutation` and `subscribe` has been renamed to `subscription` for consistency.

```kotlin
// Replace
apolloClient.query(query).await()
// With
apolloClient.query(query).execute()

// Replace
apolloClient.mutate(query).await()
// With
apolloClient.mutation(query).execute()

// Replace
apolloClient.subscribe(query).toFlow()
// With
apolloClient.subscription(subscription).toFlow()
```

### Custom Scalar adapters

Apollo Kotlin 3 ships an optional [apollo-adapters](https://apollographql.github.io/apollo-kotlin/kdoc/apollo-adapters/com.apollographql.apollo3.adapter/index.html) artifact that includes adapters for common scalar types like:

* `KotlinxInstantAdapter` for `kotlinx.datetime.Instant` ISO8601 dates
* `JavaInstantAdapter` for `java.time.Instant` ISO8601 dates
* `KotlinxLocalDateAdapter` for `kotlinx.datetime.LocalDate` ISO8601 dates
* `JavaLocalDateAdapter` for `java.time.LocalDate` ISO8601 dates
* `KotlinxLocalDateTimeAdapter` for `kotlinx.datetime.LocalDateTime` ISO8601 dates
* `JavaLocalDateTimeAdapter` for `java.time.LocalDateTime` ISO8601 dates
* `JavaOffsetDateTimeAdapter` for `java.time.OffsetDateTime` ISO8601 dates
* `DateAdapter` for `java.util.Date` ISO8601 dates
* `BigDecimalAdapter` for multiplatform `com.apollographql.apollo3.adapter.BigDecimal` class holding big decimal values

To include them, add this dependency to your gradle file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-adapters:$version")
}
```

If the above adapters do not fit your needs or if you need to customize them, you can use the Custom Scalar adapters API.

The Custom Scalar adapters API has changed a lot to support nullable and absent values as well as streaming use cases. Apollo Kotlin 3 makes it possible to read/write custom scalars without having to create an intermediate copy in memory. To do this, it uses the same `Adapter` API that is used internally to parse the models:

```kotlin
// Replace
val dateAdapter = object : CustomTypeAdapter<Date> {
  override fun decode(value: CustomTypeValue<*>): Date {
    return DATE_FORMAT.parse(value.value.toString())
  }

  override fun encode(value: Date): CustomTypeValue<*> {
    return GraphQLString(DATE_FORMAT.format(value))
  }
}

// With
val dateAdapter = object : Adapter<Date> {
  override fun fromJson(reader: JsonReader, customScalarAdapters: CustomScalarAdapters): Date {
    return DATE_FORMAT.parse(reader.nextString())
  }

  override fun toJson(writer: JsonWriter, customScalarAdapters: CustomScalarAdapters, value: Date) {
    writer.value(DATE_FORMAT.format(value))
  }
}
```

The `JsonReader` and `JsonWriter` APIs are similar to the ones you can find in [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) and are stateful APIs that require you to handle the Json properties in the order they arrive from the Json stream. If you prefer, you can also buffer the Json into an untyped `Any?` value that represent the json and use `AnyAdapter` to decode/encode it:

```kotlin
// Use AnyAdapter to convert between JsonReader/JsonWriter and a Kotlin Any value
val geoPointAdapter = object : Adapter<GeoPoint> {
  override fun fromJson(reader: JsonReader, customScalarAdapters: CustomScalarAdapters): GeoPoint {
    val map = AnyAdapter.fromJson(reader) as Map<String, Double>
    return GeoPoint(map["latitude"] as Double, map["longitude"] as Double)
  }

  override fun toJson(writer: JsonWriter, customScalarAdapters: CustomScalarAdapters, value: GeoPoint) {
    val map = mapOf(
        "latitude" to value.latitude,
        "longitude" to value.longitude
    )
    AnyAdapter.toJson(writer, map)
  }
}
```

After you define your adapters, you need to register them with your `ApolloClient` instance. To do so, call `ApolloClient.Builder.addCustomScalarAdapter` once for each adapter:

```kotlin
// Replace
val apolloClient = apolloClientBuilder.addCustomTypeAdapter(CustomType.DATE, dateAdapter).build()

// With
val apolloClient = apolloClientBuilder.addCustomScalarAdapter(Date.type, dateAdapter).build()
```

This method takes a type-safe generated class from `Types`, along with its corresponding adapter.

### Codegen

Apollo Kotlin 3.x provides 3 codegen options:

* **operationBased**: the Kotlin models map the sent GraphQL operation.
* **responseBased**: the Kotlin models map the received Json response.
* **compat**: for compatibility with Apollo Kotlin 2.x

The `compat` codegen duplicates some fields and introduce an extra `.fragments` field. While it's an easy way to migrate from 2.x, we recommend migrating to `operationBased` once your project is running in `compat` mode.

`operationBased` codegen is simpler, de-duplicates some fields and removes the intermediate `.fragments` field.

Given the following query:

```graphql
fragment humanDetails on Human {
  height
}

query GetHero {
  hero {
    name
    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }
    ...humanDetails
  }
}
```

You can migrate to `operationBased` like so:

```kotlin
// parent fields are not collected in inline fragments
// Replace
hero.asDroid?.name
// With
hero.name

// because parent fields are not collected, inline fragments
// are now named "OnFoo" instead of "AsFoo"
// Replace
hero.asDroid?.primaryFunction
// With
hero.onDroid?.primaryFunction

// there is no .fragment synthetic field for named fragments
// Replace
hero.fragments?.humanDetails?.height
// With
hero.humanDetails?.height
```

We recommend `operationBased` codegen for most projects.

To go further, and if you're you're comfortable with `operationBased` codegen, you can read more about the different codegens (including the tradeoffs of using `responseBased`) in the [design documents](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/blob/main/design-docs/Codegen.md).

### Normalized Cache

The Apollo Android 2.x runtime has a dependency on the normalized cache APIs, and it's possible to call cache methods even if no cache implementation is in the classpath.

The Apollo Kotlin 3.x runtime is more modular and doesn't know anything about normalized cache by default. To add normalized cache support, add the dependencies to your gradle file:

#### Configuration

```kotlin
dependencies {
  // Replace
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-normalized-cache:$version") // for memory cache
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite:$version") // for SQL cache

  // With
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-normalized-cache:$version") // for memory cache
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite:$version") // for SQL cache
}
```

```kotlin
// Replace
val cacheFactory = LruNormalizedCacheFactory(
                     EvictionPolicy.builder().maxSizeBytes(10 * 1024 * 1024).build()
                   )

val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(cacheFactory)
  .build()

// With
val cacheFactory = MemoryCacheFactory(maxSizeBytes = 10 * 1024 * 1024)
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(cacheFactory)
  .build()
```

Configuring the fetch policy is now made on an `ApolloCall` instance:

```kotlin
// Replace
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
                      .toBuilder()
                      .responseFetcher(ApolloResponseFetchers.CACHE_FIRST)
                      .build()
                      .await()

// With
val response = apolloClient.query(request)
                      .fetchPolicy(CacheFirst)
                      .execute()
```

#### Watchers

Watchers now default to a `CacheOnly` refetchPolicy instead `CACHE_FIRST`. To keep behaviour unchanged, set a `refetchPolicy` on your watchers:

```kotlin
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
                      .watcher()
                      .toFlow()

// With
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
                      .refetchPolicy(CacheFirst)
                      .watch()
```

#### `CacheKeyResolver`

The `CacheKeyResolver` API has been split in two different APIs:

* `CacheKeyGenerator.cacheKeyForObject`
  * takes Json data as input and returns a unique id for an object.
  * is used **after** a network request
  * is used during normalization when **writing** to the cache
* `CacheKeyResolver.cacheKeyForField`
  * takes a GraphQL field and operation variables as input and generates an id for this field
  * is used **before** a network request
  * is used when **reading** the cache

Previously, both methods were in `CacheResolver` even if under the hood, the code path were very different. By separating them, it makes it explicit and also makes it possible to only implement one of them.

At a high level,
* `fromFieldRecordSet` is renamed to `CacheKeyGenerator.cacheKeyForObject`.
* `fromFieldArguments` is renamed to `CacheKeyResolver.cacheKeyForField`.
* The `CacheKey` return value is now nullable, and `CacheKey.NONE` is replaced with `null`.

```kotlin
// Replace
val resolver: CacheKeyResolver = object : CacheKeyResolver() {
  override fun fromFieldRecordSet(field: ResponseField, recordSet: Map<String, Any>): CacheKey {
    return CacheKey.from(recordSet["id"] as String)
  }
  override fun fromFieldArguments(field: ResponseField, variables: Operation.Variables): CacheKey {
    return CacheKey.from(field.resolveArgument("id", variables) as String)
  }
}
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .normalizedCache(cacheFactory, resolver)
    .build()


// With
val cacheKeyGenerator = object : CacheKeyGenerator {
  override fun cacheKeyForObject(obj: Map<String, Any?>, context: CacheKeyGeneratorContext): CacheKey? {
    return obj["id"]?.toString()?.let { CacheKey(it) } ?: TypePolicyCacheKeyGenerator.cacheKeyForObject(obj, context)
  }
}

val cacheKeyResolver = object : CacheKeyResolver() {
  override fun cacheKeyForField(field: CompiledField, variables: Executable.Variables): CacheKey? {
    return (field.resolveArgument("id", variables) as String?)?.let { CacheKey(it) }
  }
}

val apolloClient = ApolloClient("https://").normalizedCache(
    normalizedCacheFactory = cacheFactory,
    cacheKeyGenerator = cacheKeyGenerator,
    cacheResolver = cacheKeyResolver
)
```

#### Cache misses now always throw

In Apollo Android 2, a cache miss with a `CacheOnly` policy returns an `ApolloResponse` with `response.data = null`. This was inconsistent with the `CacheFirst` policy that treats cache misses as errors.

In Apollo Android 3, calling `ApolloCall.execute()` is guaranteed to always return one valid (maybe partial) `ApolloResponse` or throw.

If you have any `CacheOnly` queries, make sure to catch their result:

```kotlin
try {
  apolloClient.query(query)
    .fetchPolicy(CacheOnly)
} catch (e: ApolloException) {
  // handle error
}
```

### HTTP cache

To add http cache support, add the dependency to your gradle file:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  // Add
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-http-cache:$version") // Gives access to `httpCache` and `httpFetchPolicy`
}
```

Similarly, the HTTP cache is configurable through extension functions:

```kotlin
// Replace
val cacheStore = DiskLruHttpCacheStore()
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("/")
    .httpCache(ApolloHttpCache(cacheStore))
    .build()

// With
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .httpCache(File(cacheDir, "apolloCache"), 1024 * 1024)
    .build()
```

Configuring the HTTP fetch policy is now made on an `ApolloCall` instance:

```kotlin
// Replace
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
                      .toBuilder()
                      .httpCachePolicy(HttpCachePolicy.CACHE_FIRST)
                      .build()
                      .await()

// With
val response = apolloClient.query(request)
                      .httpFetchPolicy(CacheFirst)
                      .execute()
```

To make it consistent with the normalized cache, the default `httpFetchPolicy` is now `HttpFetchPolicy.CacheFirst`. To keep the same behaviour as 2.0, use `HttpFetchPolicy.NetworkOnly`.

### Optional values

#### The `Optional` class

Apollo Kotlin distinguishes between `null` values and absent values.

Apollo Android 2.x uses `Input` to represent optional (maybe nullable) values for input types.

Apollo Kotlin 3.x uses `Optional` instead so that later it can potentially be used in places _besides_ input types (for example, fields could be made optional with an [`@optional`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/blob/5c1ff82ccaded93ae7126cedc6d7835e63fed75a/apollo-compiler/src/main/resources/apollo.graphqls#L6) directive).

`Optional` is a sealed class, so `when` statements don't need an `else` branch.


```kotlin
// Replace
Input.fromNullable(value)
// With
Optional.Present(value)

// Replace
Input.absent()
// With
Optional.Absent

// Replace
Input.optional(value)
// With
Optional.presentIfNotNull(value)
```

#### Non-optional variables generation

By default, the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Coercing-Variable-Values) treats nullable variables as optional, so it's valid to omit them at runtime. In practice, however, this is rarely used and makes the operation's declaration verbose.

That is why Apollo Kotlin 3.x provides a mechanism to remove the `Optional` wrapper, which makes the construction of queries with nullable variables more straightforward.

> When enabled, this new behavior applies _only_ to variables. Fields of input objects still use `Optional`, because it's common to omit particular input fields.

To omit optional variables globally in your Gradle config:

```kotlin
apollo {
  // ...
  generateOptionalOperationVariables.set(false)
}
```

If you still need to omit a variable in certain places, you can opt in to the `Optional` wrapper with the `@optional` directive:

```graphql
query GetHero($id: String @optional) {
  hero(id: $id)
}
```
More information is available [here](../advanced/operation-variables).

### Enums

Apollo Android 2.x always converts enums and enum values names to uppercase.

Apollo Kotlin 3.x uses the schema case for both enums and enum value names. This allows to define multiple enum values with a different case:

```graphql
# This now generates valid Kotlin code
enum Direction {
  left @deprecated("use LEFT instead")
  LEFT,
  RIGHT
}
```

See [#3035](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/issues/3035) for more details

### IdlingResource

In Apollo Android 2.x, you can pass an `ApolloClient` to `ApolloIdlingResource.create()` and the `ApolloClient` will be modified to register an idle callback.

In Apollo Kotlin 3.x, an `ApolloClient` is immutable once instantiated so it's not possible to register callbacks/interceptors once it is instantiated. Instead, you can create your `ApolloIdlingResource` as a first step and then pass it to your `ApolloClient.Builder` like so:

```kotlin
// Replace
val idlingResource = ApolloIdlingResource.create("ApolloIdlingResource", apolloClient)
IdlingRegistry.getInstance().register(idlingResource)

// With
val idlingResource = ApolloIdlingResource("ApolloIdlingResource")
IdlingRegistry.getInstance().register(idlingResource)
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
    .idlingResource(idlingResource)
    .build()
```

### BigDecimal

By default, Apollo Android 2.x internally maps all numbers to a custom `BigDecimal` value.

For performance reasons, Apollo Kotlin 3.x uses the primitive type when possible and moves `BigDecimal` to the `apollo-adapters` artifact.

If you are using big decimal custom scalars in your schema, you should now explicitly add them in your Gradle configuration:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-adapters:x.y.z")
}

apollo {
    mapScalar(
        "Decimal",
        "com.apollographql.apollo3.adapter.BigDecimal",
        "com.apollographql.apollo3.adapter.BigDecimalAdapter"
    )
}
```

If you are not using big decimal custom scalars, you might still be impacted if you are defining your own adapters. In that case, be prepared to receive `Int`/`Double` instead of `BigDecimal`:

```kotlin
    val customTypeAdapter = object: CustomTypeAdapter<Address> {
      override fun decode(value: CustomTypeValue<*>): Address {
        check (value is CustomTypeValue.GraphQLJsonObject)

        val street = value.value["street"] as String

        // BigDecimal is not exposed anymore
        // Replace
        // val number = value.value["number"] as BigDecimal

        // With
        val number = value.value["number"] as Int

        return Address(street, number)
      }
    }
```

By default, numbers are mapped to `Int` or `Double` if they don't fit in an `Int`. If the number doesn't fit in a `Double` either, it will fallback to a `JsonNumber` containing the String representation of the number.

### ApolloLogger

Apollo Android 2.x has a `ApolloLogger` interface. One of the main use cases was to log cache misses.

Apollo Android 3.x removes this interface and exposes the information in APIs instead. APIs offer a more structured and maintainable way to expose data.

For custom logging, you can now use an `ApolloInterceptor`.

For cache misses, you can use the convenience `ApolloClient.Builder.logCacheMisses()`:

```kotlin
    val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
        .serverUrl(mockServer.url())

### Subscriptions

Apollo Android 2.x had a `SubscriptionManager` class. This class exposed a lot of methods and data about the Websocket state management. While very flexible, it was hard to maintain and evolve.

Apollo Android 3.x instead uses `WebsocketNetworkTransport` to expose a simplified API:

- `protocolFactory` allows using `graphql-ws` or AppSync (or your custom one) as a lowlevel protocol instead of the default.
- `reopenWhen` allows to automatically re-subscribe in case of a network error or another error.

If you were previously using `apolloClient.subscriptionManager.reconnect()` to force a Websocket reconnect (for example
to send new authentication parameters), you can now
call `apolloClient.subscriptionNetworkTransport.closeConnection(<your exception>)`: this will behave as if a network
error occurred, and you can react to this by reconnecting with `reopenWhen`.

If you were previously using `subscriptionConnectionParams` to authenticate your subscription, you can now use
`wsProtocol` with a `connectionPayload` passed inside the `SubscriptionWsProtocol.Factory`. More information can be
found in [Authenticating your WebSockets](/kotlin/advanced/authentication#authenticating-your-websockets).

If you feel some API is missing from `SubscriptionManager`,
please [reach out](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%3Asparkles%3A+Type%3A+Feature&template=feature_request.md&title=)
so we can discuss the best way to add them.

### Downloading schemas

Because it is not possible to determine the Gradle current working directory reliably, the `downloadApolloSchema` task now uses paths relative to the root project directory:

```
# schema is now interpreted relative to the root project directory and
# not the current working directory anymore. This example assumes there
# is a 'app' module that applies the apollo plugin
./gradlew downloadApolloSchema \
  --endpoint="https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint" \
  --schema="app/src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls"
```

If you configured the `introspection {}` or `registry {}` blocks in your Gradle scripts, you should now use `downloadServiceApolloSchemaFromIntrospection` or `downloadServiceApolloSchemaFromRegistry`

### OkHttp

Because 3.x is multiplatform first, the runtime abstracts OkHttp behind the [HttpEngine API](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/http-engine#the-httpengine-interface). If you were relying on `OkHttpExecutionContext`, you can now use `HttpInfo` to get access to the HTTP response code and headers:

```kotlin
// Replace
response.executionContext[OkHttpExecutionContext].response.code

// With
response.executionContext[HttpInfo]?.statusCode
```

### Using models without the runtime

The API have changed to allow streaming use cases. To compose a request body:

```kotlin
// Replace
val request = query.composeRequestBody()

// With
val request = buildJsonString {
  query.composeJsonRequest(this, CustomScalarAdapters.Empty)
}
```

To parse a response body:

```kotlin
// Replace
val response = query.parse(bufferedSource);

// With
val response = query.parseJsonResponse(bufferedSource);
```

### `refetchQueries()`

Apollo Android 2.x exposes a `ApolloCall.Builder.refetchQueries(List<Query>)`. This was used to get new values from the network after a mutation that potentially impacts other queries. This gave little control over error handling, caching or concurrency.

Apollo Kotlin 3.x exposes a coroutine API that make it easy to implement similar functionality without library support. Coroutines make it easy to chain calls, retry in case of error or change the dispatcher. For a simple version, you can do something like this:

```kotlin
  suspend fun <MutationData: Mutation.Data> mutation(mutation: Mutation<MutationData>, vararg refetchQueries: Query<*>) {
    apolloClient.mutation(mutation).execute()
    refetchQueries.forEach {
      apolloClient.query(it).execute()
    }
  }  
```

If you want to bind the refetches to the scope of your ApolloClient, you can do:

```kotlin
  suspend fun <MutationData: Mutation.Data> mutation(mutation: Mutation<MutationData>, vararg refetchQueries: Query<*>) {
    apolloClient.mutation(mutation).execute()
    apolloClient.executionContext[ConcurrencyInfo]!!.coroutineScope.launch {
      refetchQueries.forEach {
        apolloClient.query(it).execute()
      }
    }
  }
```
It is not planned to add `refetchQueries()` in the library.
