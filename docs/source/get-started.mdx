Hello! This article walks you through adding Apollo Android to your project.

## Add the Gradle plugin

<AddPlugin />

## Add runtime dependencies

```kotlin:title=build.gradle[.kts]
dependencies {
  // The core runtime dependencies
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime:$version")
}
```

Or for a multiplatform project:

```kotlin:title=build.gradle[.kts]
kotlin {
  sourceSets {
    val commonMain by getting {
      dependencies {
        implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime:$version")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Download your schema file

<DownloadSchema />

## Add your query

<AddQuery />

## Execute your query

In your application code, create an instance of `ApolloClient`, providing your GraphQL server's URL where indicated:

```kotlin
// Replace the serverUrl with your GraphQL endpoint
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder().serverUrl("https://your.domain/graphql").build()
```

Now you can execute your defined query with `ApolloClient` like so:

```kotlin
// Replace `runBlocking {}` with `viewModelScope.launch {}`
// or any other coroutine scope builder
runBlocking {
  val response = try {
    apolloClient.query(LaunchDetailsQuery(id = "83"))
  } catch (e: ApolloException) {
    // handle network errors
    return@runBlocking
  }

  val launch = response.data?.launch
  if (launch == null || response.hasErrors()) {
    // A response containing errors and possibly partial data is received
    // Display the partial data or handle GraphQL errors here
    return@runBlocking
  }

  // launch now contains a typesafe model of your data
  println("Launch site: ${launch.site}")
}
```

> Apollo Android uses coroutines to handle concurrency. If you're using Java, see [RxJava2](usage/rxjava2) for an alternative way to execute your queries.
