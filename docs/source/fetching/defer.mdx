title: 'Using the @defer directive in Apollo Kotlin'
description: 'Fetch slower schema fields asynchronously'

<ExperimentalFeature>

**The `@defer` directive is currently [experimental](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/product-launch-stages/#experimental-features) in Apollo Kotlin.** If you have feedback on it, please let us know via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug&template=bug_report.md) or in the [Kotlin Slack community](https://slack.kotl.in/).

</ExperimentalFeature>

Apollo Kotlin provides experimental support of [the `@defer` directive](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md), which enables your queries to receive data for specific fields asynchronously. This is helpful whenever some fields in a query take much longer to resolve than the others.

For example, let's say we're building a social media application that can quickly fetch a user's basic profile information, but retrieving that user's friends takes longer. If we include _all_ of those fields in a single query, we want to be able to display the profile information as soon as it's available, instead of waiting for the friend fields to resolve.

To achieve this, we can apply the `@defer` directive to an inline fragment that contains all slow-resolving fields related to friend data:

```graphql
query PersonQuery($personId: ID!) {
  person(id: $personId) {
    # Basic fields (fast)
    id
    firstName
    lastName

    # highlight-start
    # Friend fields (slower)
    ... on User @defer {
      friends {
        id
      }
    }
    # highlight-end
  }
}
```

In the generated code for this query, the `onUser` field for the fragment will be nullable. That is because when the initial payload is received from the server, the fields of the fragment are not yet present. A `Person` will be emitted with only the basic fields filled in.

When the fields of the fragment are available, a new `Person` will be emitted, this time with the `onUser` field present and filled with the fields of the fragment.

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(PersonQuery(personId)).toFlow().collect {
  println("Received: $it")
  if (it.dataOrThrow().person.onUser == null) {
    // Initial payload: basic info only
    // ...
  } else {
    // Subsequent payload: with friends
    // ...
  }
}
```

Will print something like this:

```
Received: Person(id=1, firstName=John, lastName=Doe, onUser=null))
Received: Person(id=1, firstName=John, lastName=Doe, onUser=OnUser(friends=[Friend(id=2), Friend(id=3)]))
```

### Limitations/known issues
* `@defer` cannot be used with `responseBased` codegen.
* Some servers might send an empty payload to signal the end of the stream. In such a case you will receive an extra terminal emission. You can filter it out by using `distinctUntilChangedBy()`:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(MyQuery()).toFlow()
    .distinctUntilChangedBy { it.data }  // filter out duplicates
    .collect { /* ... */ }
```
