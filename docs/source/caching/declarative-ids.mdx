title: Declarative cache IDs in Apollo Kotlin
---

When using a [normalized cache](./normalized-cache/) in Apollo Kotlin, it's recommended that you specify a **cache ID** for each object type in your schema. If you don't, objects are assigned a _default_ cache ID, but that ID can lead to undesirable duplication of data.

When specifying cache IDs, it's recommended that you do so **declaratively**, using the methods described in this article:

```graphql
extend type Book @typePolicy(keyFields: "id")
```

> For advanced use cases, you can also define cache IDs [programmatically](programmatic-ids).

## How they work

With declarative cache IDs, the codegen process adds ID fields automatically and generates type-safe code that can return a valid cache ID for any object.

To do this, Apollo Kotlin extends your backend schema. The GraphQL spec supports [object extensions](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Object-Extensions) using the `extend type` keywords. We can use this together with the `@typePolicy` and `@fieldPolicy` directives, along with an extra `.graphqls` file named `extra.graphqls`.

Note that you'll need to make sure that the `extra.graphqls` file is included in your [schema configuration](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/plugin-configuration#combining-multiple-schema-files).

You can obtain a given object type's cache ID from one of two sources:

| Source                                                 | Directive | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| From a response object's fields (e.g., `Book.id`)      | [`@typePolicy`](#typepolicy) | This happens _after_ a network request and is essential to merging a query result with existing cached data. This is the most common case. |
| From a field's arguments (e.g., `author(id: "au456")`) | [`@fieldPolicy`](#fieldpolicy) | This happens _before_ a network request and enables you to avoid a network round trip if all requested data is in the cache already. This is an optional optimization that can avoid some cache misses. |

## `@typePolicy`

The `@typePolicy` directive enables you to specify an object's cache ID from **key fields** of the object returned by your GraphQL server. Most commonly, you can use an object's `id` field as its key field.

For example, let's say our app's `schema.graphqls` file includes the following definition:

```graphql title="schema.graphqls"
type Book {
  id: String!
  author: Author!
  title: String!
}
```

We can add the following definition to an `extra.graphqls` file in the same directory as our schema:

```graphql title="extra.graphqls"
extend type Book @typePolicy(keyFields: "id")
```

Apollo Kotlin now knows to use the `id` field of a `Book` type to generate its cache ID. A cache record may now look like

```
"Book:bk123": {"id": "bk123", "title": "Les guerriers du silence", "author": "ApolloCacheReference{favoriteBook.author}"}
```

You can specify _multiple_ key fields for an object if they're all required to uniquely identify a particular cache entry:


```graphql title="extra.graphqls"
extend type Author @typePolicy(keyFields: "firstName lastName")
```

In this case, the cache ID for an `Author` object includes the values of both its `firstName` and `lastName` fields:

```
"Author:PierreBordage": {"id": "au456", "firstName": "Pierre", "lastName": "Bordage"}
```

> All of an object type's key fields must return a [scalar type](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/schema/#scalar-types).

> Note that the **key fields** specified this way will automatically be added during code generation to selections on the object type, since they are always needed to identify the object in the cache.
> This means you don't need to include them in your queries.

## Adding `__typename` to your operations

In addition to the key fields, the declarative cache requires the `__typename` of each object by default. These typenames are not included by default as they make query larger for non-cache users. To avoid cache misses, add `__typename` to every selection using [addTypename](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/kdoc/apollo-gradle-plugin-external/com.apollographql.apollo.gradle.api/-service/add-typename.html):

```kotlin
apollo {
  service("service") {
    addTypename.set("always")
  }
}
```

## `@fieldPolicy`

The `@fieldPolicy` directive enables you to specify an object's cache ID from the values of **key arguments** you provide to a particular field. This enables you to identify an object in your cache _before_ sending a network request, potentially enabling you to skip the request entirely.

For example, let's say our app's `schema.graphqls` file includes the following definition:

```graphql title="schema.graphqls"
type Query {
  book(id: String!): Book
}
```

We happen to know that this query returns whichever `Book` object has an `id` field that matches the required argument. Therefore, we can make the `id` argument a key argument for this field.

We can add the following definition to an `extra.graphqls` file in the same directory as our schema:

```graphql title="extra.graphqls"
extend type Query @fieldPolicy(forField: "book", keyArgs: "id")
```

Apollo Kotlin now knows to check the cache for a `Book` object with the provided `id` _before_ sending a network request for `Query.book`.

> Note that even though the `@fieldPolicy` directive corresponds to a single field, you apply the directive to the _type_ definition (`Query` in this case). This is because GraphQL doesn't allow extending a single field. You specify _which_ field the directive corresponds to with the `forField` argument.

You can specify _multiple_ key arguments for a field if they're all required to uniquely identify a particular cache entry:

```graphql title="extra.graphqls"
extend type Query @fieldPolicy(forField: "author", keyArgs: "firstName lastName")
```

In this case, the cache ID for an `Author` object includes the values of both its `firstName` and `lastName` fields, which are both provided as arguments to the `Query.author` field.

If multiple fields of an object type have key arguments, you can apply multiple `@fieldPolicy` directives to that type.
