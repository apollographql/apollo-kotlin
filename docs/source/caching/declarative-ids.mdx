title: Declarative cache ids
---

> Using declarative cache ids is the recommended way to define your cache ids. For a more flexible (and more complex API), you can also define your cache ids [programmatically](programmatic-ids).

Declaratively specifying your cache ids allows the codegen to add the id fields automatically and generates type-safe code that can return a valid cache id for any object or field.

It works by extending the backend schema. The GraphQL spec allows [object extensions](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Object-Extensions) using the `extend type` keywords. In our case, this can be used together with the `@typePolicy` and `@fieldPolicy` directives and an extra '.graphqls' file that we will name `extra.graphqls`.

Cache ids are computed from two sources:

1. From the object fields (`author.id`)
2. From a field arguments (`author(id)`)


1. is happening **after** a network request and is important to merge the network response with existing data. This is the most usual case.
2. is happening **before** a network request and is important to avoid a network round trip if all the data is in the cache already. This is an optimization that can avoid some cache misses.

With declarative cache ids:

1. uses `@typePolicy`
2. uses `@fieldPolicy`

## @typePolicy

`@typePolicy` allows to specify the id from object fields returned **after** a network request.

Its definition is:

```graphql
# Marks fields as key fields. Key fields are used to compute the cache key of an object
# `keyFields` should contain a selection set. Composite fields are not supported yet.
directive @typePolicy(keyFields: String!) on OBJECT
```

With the following schema type in your `schema.graphqls` file:

```graphql
# we're in schema.graphqls
type Book {
  id: String!
  author: Author!
  title: String!
}
```

You can extend the `Book` type by adding a `extra.graphqls` file next to your `schema.graphqls`:

```graphql
# we're in extra.graphqls
extend type Book @typePolicy(keyFields: "id")
```

You can specify any combination of scalar fields in `keyFields`. For an example, you could identify an `Author` with their `firstName-lastName` pair:

```graphql
# we're in extra.graphqls
extend type Author @typePolicy(keyFields: "firstName lastName")
```

The codegen will recognize the id field and generate the correct cache id every time you use it in a query.

## @fieldPolicy

`@fieldPolicy` allows to specify the id from field arguments **before** going to the network.

Its definition is:

```graphql
# Indicates how to compute a key from a field arguments.
directive @fieldPolicy(forField: String!, keyArgs: String!) on OBJECT
```

With the following schema type in your `schema.graphqls` file:

```graphql
# we're in schema.graphqls
type Query {
  book(id: String!)
}
```

You can tell the cache to use the `id` argument to lookup the requested book in the cache.

```graphql
# we're in extra.graphqls
extend type Query @fieldPolicy(forField: "book", keyArgs: "id")
```

Because this happens at the field level and there are no field extensions in the GraphQL language, you'll need to specify `forField` in the directive.

Similarly to `@typePolicy`, you can use and selection set of scalar fields to identify an object from its arguments:

```
extend type Query @fieldPolicy(forField: "author", keyArgs: "firstName lastName")
```

The codegen will recognize the id argument and generate the correct cache id every time you use it in a query.
