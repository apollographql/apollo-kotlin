title: Normalized cache

import {MultiCodeBlock} from 'gatsby-theme-apollo-docs';

Apollo Android provides two different kinds of caches: an HTTP cache and a normalized cache. The HTTP cache is easier to set up but also has more limitations. This page focuses on the normalized cache. If you're looking for a simpler albeit coarser cache, take a look at the [HTTP cache](http-cache).

## Data Normalization:

The normalized cache stores objects by ID.

```graphql
query BookWithAuthorName {
  favoriteBook {
    id
    title
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

query AuthorById($id: String!) {
  author(id: $id) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, requesting the author of your favorite book with the `AuthorById` query will return a result from the cache if you requested your favorite book before. This works because the author is stored only once in the cache and all the fields were retrieved in the initial `BookWithAuthorName` query. If you were to request more fields, like `birthdate` for example, that wouldn't work anymore.

## Storing your data in memory

Apollo Android comes with a `MemoryCache` that will store your data in memory:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
// Create a 10MB MemoryCacheFactory
val cacheFactory = MemoryCacheFactory(maxSizeBytes = 10 * 1024 * 1024)

// Build the ApolloClient
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(cacheFactory)
  .build()
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Persisting your data in a SQLite database

If the amount of data you store becomes too big to fit in memory or if you want your data to persist between app restarts, you can also use a `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory`. A `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory` will store your data in a [SQLDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) database and is defined in a separate dependency:

```kotlin:title=build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite:x.y.z")
}
```

**Note:** The `apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite` dependency has Kotlin multiplatform support and has multiple variants (`-jvm`, `-android`, `-ios-arm64`,...). If you are targeting Android and using custom `buildTypes`, you will need to help Gradle resolve the correct artifact by defining [matchingFallbacks](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies?authuser=2#resolve_matching_errors):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin:title=build.gradle
android {
  buildTypes {
    create("custom") {
      // your code...
      matchingFallbacks = listOf("debug")
    }
  }
}
```

```groovy:title=build.gradle
android {
  buildTypes {
    custom {
      // your code...
      matchingFallbacks = ["debug"]
    }
  }
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Once the dependency is added, create the `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
// Android
val sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory(context, "apollo.db")
// JVM
val sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory("jdbc:sqlite:apollo.db")
// iOS
val sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory("apollo.db")

// Build the ApolloClient
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(sqlNormalizedCacheFactory)
  .build()
```


</MultiCodeBlock>

## Chaining caches

To get the best of both caches, you can chain an `MemoryCacheFactory` with a `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin

val sqlCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory(context, "db_name")
val memoryFirstThenSqlCacheFactory = MemoryCacheFactory(10 * 1024 * 1024)
  .chain(sqlCacheFactory)

```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Reads will read from the first cache hit in the chain. Writes will propagate down the entire chain.

## Specifying your object IDs

By default, Apollo Android uses the field path as key to store data. Back to the original example:

```graphl
query BookWithAuthorName {
  favoriteBook {
    id
    title
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

query AuthorById($id: String!) {
  author(id: $id) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

This will store the following records:

* `"favoriteBook"`: `{"id": "book1", "title": "Les guerriers du silence", "author": "ApolloCacheReference{favoriteBook.author}"}`
* `"favoriteBook.author"`: `{"id": "author1", name": "Pierre Bordage"}`
* `"author("id": "author1")"`: `{"id": "author1", "name": "Pierre Bordage"}`
* `"QUERY_ROOT"`: `{"favoriteBook": "ApolloCacheReference{favoriteBook}", "author(\"id\": \"author1\")": "ApolloCacheReference{author(\"id\": \"author1\")}"}`

This is undesirable, both because it takes more space, and because modifying one of those objects will not notify the watchers of the other. What you want instead is this:

* `"book1"`: `{"id": "book1", "title": "Les guerriers du silence", "author": "ApolloCacheReference{author1}"}`
* `"author1"`: `{"id": "author1", name": "Pierre Bordage"}`
* `"QUERY_ROOT"`: `{"favoriteBook": "book1", "author(\"id\": \"author1\")": "author1"}`

To do this, specify an `ObjectIdGenerator` and a `CacheResolver` when configuring your `NormalizedCacheFactory`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin

val objectIdGenerator = object : ObjectIdGenerator {
  override fun cacheKeyForObject(obj: Map<String, Any?>, context: ObjectIdGeneratorContext): CacheKey? {
    // Retrieve the id from the object itself
    return CacheKey(obj["id"] as String)
  }
}

val resolver: CacheResolver = object : CacheKeyResolver() {
  override fun cacheKeyForField(field: CompiledField, variables: Executable.Variables): CacheKey? {
    // Retrieve the id from the field arguments.
    // In the example, this allows to know that `author(id: "author1")` will retrieve `author1`
    // That sounds straightforward but without this, the cache would have no way of finding the id before executing the request on the
    // network which is what we want to avoid
    return CacheKey(field.resolveArgument("id", variables) as String)
  }
}

val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .normalizedCache(
        normalizedCacheFactory = cacheFactory,
        objectIdGenerator = objectIdGenerator,
        cacheResolver = resolver,
    )
    .build()
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

For this resolver to work, every object in your graph needs to have a globally unique ID. If some of them don't have one, you can fall back to using the path as cache key by returning `null`.

## Using the cache with your queries

You control how the cache is used with [`fetchPolicy`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/blob/main/apollo-normalized-cache/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/apollographql/apollo3/cache/normalized/ClientCacheExtensions.kt):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
// Get a response from the cache if possible. Else, get a response from the network
// This is the default behavior
val query = ApolloRequest.Builder(BookWithAuthorName())
  .fetchPolicy(FetchPolicy.CacheFirst)
  .build()
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Other possibilities are `CacheOnly`, `NetworkOnly`, `CacheFirst` and `NetworkFirst`. See the [`FetchPolicy` enum](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/blob/main/apollo-normalized-cache/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/apollographql/apollo3/cache/normalized/ClientCacheExtensions.kt) for more details.

## Reacting to changes in the cache

One big advantage of using a normalized cache is that your UI can now react to changes in your cache data. If you want to be notified every time something changes in `book1`, you can _watch_ a query:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
  apolloClient.watch(BookWithAuthorName()).collect { response ->
      // This will be called every time the book or author changes
  }
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Interacting with the cache

To manipulate the cache directly, `ApolloStore` exposes `readOperation`/`readFragment` and `writeOperation`/`writeFragment` methods:

```kotlin
  // Reading data from the store
  val data = apolloClient.apolloStore.readOperation(BookWithAuthorName())

  // Create data to write
  val data = BookWithAuthorName.Data(
    id = "book1",
    title = "Les guerriers du silence",
    author = BookWithAuthorName.Author(
      id = "author1",
      name = "Pierre Bordage"
    )
  )
  // Write to the store. All watchers will be notified
  apolloClient.apolloStore.writeOperation(BookWithAuthorName(), data)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing cache misses, check your cache size and eviction policy. Some records might have been removed from the cache. Increasing the cache size and/or retention period will help hitting your cache more consistently. 

If you are still experiencing cache misses, you can dump the contents of the cache:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
val dump = apolloClient.apolloStore().dump()
NormalizedCache.prettifyDump(dump)
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Make sure that no data is duplicated in the dump. If it is the case, it probably means that some objects have a wrong `CacheKey`. Make sure to provide a `CacheKeyResolver` that can work with your graph. All objects should have a unique and stable ID. That means that the ID should be the same no matter what path the object is in the graph. That also mean you have to include the identifier field in your queries to be able to use in from the `CacheKeyResolver`.

Finally, make sure to design your queries so that you can reuse fields. A single missing field in the cache for a query will trigger a network fetch. Sometimes it might be useful to query an extra field early on so that it can be reused by other later queries.
