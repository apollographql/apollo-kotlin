title: Programmatic cache ids
---

> Using programmatic cache ids is the more flexible option but comes at the price of a complex API. For a compile-time, type-safe and simpler way to define your cache ids, you also use [declarative cache ids](declarative-ids).

As explained in [the normalized cache page](normalized-cache), defining unique cache ids is important to avoid duplication and make sure your watchers get notified whenever a relevant change in the store happens.

Cache ids are computed from two sources:

1. From the object fields (`author.id`)
2. From a field arguments (`author(id)`)


1. is happening **after** a network request and is important to merge the network response with existing data. This is the most usual case.
2. is happening **before** a network request and is important to avoid a network round trip if all the data is in the cache already. This is an optimization that can avoid some cache misses.

With programmatic cache ids:

1. uses `CacheKeyGenerator`
2. uses `CacheKeyResolver`


## CacheKeyGenerator

To customize how cache ids are built from object fields, create a new instance of `CacheKeyGenerator`:

```kotlin
val objectIdGenerator = object : CacheKeyGenerator {
  override fun cacheKeyForObject(obj: Map<String, Any?>, context: CacheKeyGeneratorContext): CacheKey? {
    // Retrieve the id from the object itself
    return CacheKey(obj["id"] as String)
  }
}
```

And pass it when configuring your normalized cache:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .normalizedCache(
        normalizedCacheFactory = cacheFactory,
        objectIdGenerator = objectIdGenerator,
    )
    .build()
```

If you need the object typename, you can access it through `context`:

```kotlin
val objectIdGenerator = object : CacheKeyGenerator {
  override fun cacheKeyForObject(obj: Map<String, Any?>, context: CacheKeyGeneratorContext): CacheKey? {
    val typename = context.field.type.leafType().name
    val id = obj["id"] as String

    return CacheKey(typename, id)
  }
}
```

Note how this requires `id` to be present in the response. If a query does not return this field, the `CacheKey` will be inconsistent and duplication will happen.

## CacheKeyResolver

To customize how cache ids are built from fields arguments (before going to the network), create a new instance of `CacheKeyResolver`:

```kotlin
val cacheKeyResolver = object: CacheKeyResolver() {
  override fun cacheKeyForField(field: CompiledField, variables: Executable.Variables): CacheKey? {
    // [field] contains compile-time information about what type of object is being resolved
    // Even though we call leafType() here, we're guaranteed that the type is a composite type and not a list
    val typename = field.type.leafType().name

    // resolveArgument will return the runtime value of the "id" argument from either
    // the variables or as a litteral value
    val id = field.resolveArgument("id", variables)

    if (id is String) {
      // This field has an id argument, so we can use it to compute a cache key
      return CacheKey(typename, id)
    }

    // Return null to use the default handling
    return null
  }
}
```

And pass it when configuring the normalized cache:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .normalizedCache(
        normalizedCacheFactory = cacheFactory,
        objectIdGenerator = objectIdGenerator,
        cacheResolver = cacheKeyResolver
    )
    .build()
```

There's a lot going on up there.

The first thing to be aware of is that this function will be called for every composite field in your operation so it's important to return `null` if you don't want to handle this field.

The second thing is that it will only be called for composite fields and not for lists of composite fields. Say you have a query like this:

```graphql
query GetBooks($ids: [String!]!) {
  books(ids: $ids) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

To have the cache lookup all books from `ids`, uou'll need to override `listOfCacheKeysForField`:

```kotlin
  override fun listOfCacheKeysForField(field: CompiledField, variables: Executable.Variables): List<CacheKey?>? {
    // note how field can be of list type here
    val typename = field.type.leafType().name

    // resolveArgument will return the runtime value of the "id" argument from either
    // the variables or as a litteral value
    val ids = field.resolveArgument("ids", variables)

    if (ids is List<*>) {
      // This field has an id argument, so we can use it to compute a cache key
      return ids.map { CacheKey(typename, it as String) }
    }

    // Return null to use the default handling
    return null
  }
```

For the sake of simplicity, only one level of list is supported. If you need more nested lists, you can implement `CacheResolver`. `CacheResolver` is a generalization of `CacheKeyResolver` and can be used to return any value from the cache, even scalar values:

```kotlin
val cacheResolver = object: CacheResolver {
  override fun resolveField(
      field: CompiledField,
      variables: Executable.Variables,
      parent: Map<String, @JvmSuppressWildcards Any?>,
      parentId: String,
  ): Any? {

    var type = field.type
    var listDepth = 0

    while (true) {
      when (type) {
        is CompiledNotNullType -> type = type.ofType
        is CompiledListType -> {
          listDepth++
          type = type.ofType
        }
        else -> break
      }
    }

    // Now type points to the leaf type and lestDepth is the nesting of lists required

    // Return a kotlin value for this field
    // No type checking is done here so it must match the expected GraphQL type

    if (listDepth == 2) {
      return listOf(listOf("0", "1"))
    }

    // CacheResolver must always call DefaultCacheResolver last or all fields will be null else
    return DefaultCacheResolver.resolveField(field, variables, parent, parentId)
  }
}
```
