title: Query watchers

Because the normalized cache deduplicates all your data, and if you defined your cache ids, you can use the cache as the source of truth for your UI and be automatically notified when some data changes. For this you can use `ApolloQueryCall.watch`

## Watching a query

Assuming you have the following queries for a collaborative todo list app:

```graphql
query AllTodos {
  items {
    id
    checked
    title
  }
}
```

```graphql
query TodoDetails($id: String!) {
  item(id: $id) {
    id
    checked
    title
    content
  }
}
```

The `AllTodos` returns a list of all Item along with their title and checked status:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "0",
        "title": "Write code for Apollo Android 3",
        "checked": true,
      },
      {
        "id": "1",
        "title": "Write documentation for Apollo Android 3",
        "checked": false,
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If someone clicks on item "1", it opens the details of the todo. Because it's a collaborative todo list, someone might have changed the content on the server. Maybe someone else wrote the documentation for `Apollo Android 3` and set the 'checked' field to 'true'. In this case, the TodoDetails query will return something like this:

```json{6-7}
{
  "data": {
    "item": {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Write documentation for Apollo Android 3",
      "checked": true,
      "content": "Do not forget documentation about the normalized cache!"
    }
  }
}
```

With a regular query, you'd have to update the data when going back to the main list screen. Using `watch()` instead, your main screen can be updated automatically without any additional logic:

```kotlin
apolloClient.query(TodoDetailsQuery())
            .watch()
            .collect { response ->
              // update the UI every time the data changes
            }
```

## Updating the cache after a mutation

Most of the times, the data changes do not come from the backend but are triggered by the users themselves using a mutation. For an example, the user could change the status from the app:

```graphql
mutation SetTodoChecked($id: String!, $checked: Boolean!) {
  setTodoChecked(id: $id, checked: $checked) { # this returns an item
    id
  }
}
```

The above mutation will change the 'checked' status on the server but not in the cache because the response does not contain the 'checked' field. If you want the cache to be automatically updated, you need to include all the changed fields in the response:

 ```graphql
 mutation SetTodoChecked($id: String!, $checked: Boolean!) {
   setTodoChecked(id: $id, checked: $checked) {
     id
     # ask for checked to update the cache
     checked
   }
 }
 ```

> Note: For this to work, it's important that your schema allows to returns all potentially modified fields.

Because `setTodoChecked` above is of `Item` type and contains an "id" field and the "checked" field, the result of the mutation is going to update the cache automatically when the network response is received. Any watcher listening to `"Item:1.checked"` will be automatically notified.

## Optimistic updates

Sometimes you want to update the cache without waiting for the network response. In that case, you can use optimistic updates:

```kotlin
apolloClient.mutation(SetTodoCheckedMutation(id = "1", checked = true))
            .optimisticResponse(
              SetTodoCheckedMutation.Data(
                id = "1",
                checked = true,
              )
            )
            .execute()
```
