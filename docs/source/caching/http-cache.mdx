title: HTTP cache
---


> This page focuses on the HTTP cache. If you want to deduplicate the storage of your objects and/or notify your UI when your data changes, take a look at the [normalized cache](./normalized-cache) instead.

> ℹ️ The HTTP cache is only available on the JVM.

## Setup

To enable HTTP cache support, add the dependency to your project's `build.gradle` file:

```kotlin title="build.gradle[.kts]"
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-http-cache:4.0.0-beta.7")
}
```

If you're targeting Android API level < 26, you'll need to enable [core library desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring) to support the `java.time` API:

```kotlin
android {
    compileOptions {
        // Flag to enable support for the new language APIs
        coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
    }
}
```

Then configure your HTTP cache:

```kotlin
apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .httpCache(
      // Use a dedicated directory for the cache
      directory = File(pathToCacheDirectory),
      // Configure a max size of 100MB
      maxSize = 100 * 1024 * 1024
    )
    .build()
```

## Usage

The HTTP cache is a least recently used (LRU) cache with a configurable max size.

Once your cache setup is complete, the cache will be used by default by all your queries (mutations are never cached). By default, queries will try to find a result in the cache first and go the network if it's not there. This is the `HttpFetchPolicy.CacheFirst`. You can customize that behaviour with `httpFetchPolicy(HttpFetchPolicy)`:

```kotlin
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
                 // Don't use the cache
                 .httpFetchPolicy(HttpFetchPolicy.NetworkOnly)

                 // Or only use the cache
                 .httpFetchPolicy(HttpFetchPolicy.CacheOnly)

                 // Finally, execute your query
                 .execute()
```

If the query is present in cache, it will be used to return `response.data`. If not, a `HttpCacheMissException` will be thrown.

You can also set an expiration time either globally or for specific queries. The entries will automatically be removed from the cache after the expiration time:

```kotlin
// Globally
apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .httpCache(/*...*/)
    // Expire after 1 hour
    .httpExpireTimeout(60 * 60 * 1000)
    .build()

// On a specific query
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
    // Expire after 1 hour
    .httpExpireTimeout(60 * 60 * 1000)
    .execute()
```

If a specific query must not be cached, you can use `httpDoNotStore()`:

```kotlin
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
    // Don't cache this query
    .httpDoNotStore(httpDoNotStore = true)
    .execute()
```

## Clearing the cache

Call `apolloClient.httpCache.clearAll()` to clear the cache of all entries.
