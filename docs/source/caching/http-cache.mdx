title: HTTP cache
---


> This page focuses on the HTTP cache. If you want to deduplicate the storage of your objects and/or notify your UI when your data changes, take a look at the [normalized cache](./normalized-cache) instead.

> ℹ️ The HTTP cache is only available on the JVM.

To enable HTTP cache support, add the dependency to your project's `build.gradle` file:

```kotlin:title=build.gradle[.kts]
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-http-cache:3.1.0")
}
```

If you're targeting Android API level < 26, you'll need to enable [core library desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring) to support the `java.time` API:

```kotlin
android {
    compileOptions {
        // Flag to enable support for the new language APIs
        coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
        // Sets Java compatibility to Java 8
        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}
```

Then configure your HTTP cache:

```kotlin
apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .httpCache(
      // Use a dedicated directory for the cache
      directory = File(pathToCacheDirectory),
      // Configure a max size of 100MB
      maxSize = 100 * 1024 * 1024
    )
    .build()
```

The HTTP cache is a least recently used (LRU) cache with a configurable max size.

Once your cache setup is complete, the cache will be used by default by all your queries. By default, queries will try to find a result in the cache first and go the network if it's not there. This is the `HttpFetchPolicy.CacheFirst`. You can customize that behaviour with `httpFetchPolicy(HttpFetchPolicy)`:

```kotlin
val response = apolloClient.query(query)
                 // Don't use the cache
                 .httpFetchPolicy(HttpFetchPolicy.NetworkOnly)

                 // Or only use the cache
                 .httpFetchPolicy(HttpFetchPolicy.CacheOnly)

                 // Finally, execute your query
                 .execute()
```

If the query is present in cache, it will be used to return `response.data`. If not, a `HttpCacheMissException` will be thrown.
