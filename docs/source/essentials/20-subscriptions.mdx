Subscriptions are long-lived GraphQL read operations that can update their response over time, enabling clients to receive updates as they occur. They're usually implemented as a connection to a GraphQL server over WebSocket (including in Apollo Android).

You define a subscription in your app just like you define a query, except you use the `subscription` keyword. Here's an example subscription for getting the latest value of a number whenever that number is incremented:

```graphql
subscription NumberIncremented {
  numberIncremented
}
```

Unlike with queries and mutations, a subscription operation can include only _one_ field of the `Subscription` type. To subscribe to multiple fields, you create multiple subscription operations.

## Configuring the network transport

Because subscriptions usually use WebSocket instead of HTTP, you need to customize the `NetworkTransport`. To support this, Apollo Android provides `WebSocketNetworkTransport`:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient(
  networkTransport = WebSocketNetworkTransport(
    serverUrl = "https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql"
  )
)
```

`WebSocketNetworkTransport` helps you customize the protocol for different backends via the `WsProtocol` interface. It includes built-in support for AppSync with `AppSyncWsProtocol` and [graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws) `GraphQLWsProtocol`.

For example, you can configure a `graphql-ws` transport like so:

```kotlin
val apolloClient = ApolloClient(
  networkTransport = WebSocketNetworkTransport(
    serverUrl = "http://localhost:9090/graphql",
    protocol = GraphQLWsProtocol()
  )
)
```

## Listening to a subscription

After you configure the `NetworkTransport`, use `ApolloClient.subscribe` to open the connection and listen for changes:

```kotlin
apolloClient.subscribe(TripsBookedSubscription())
  .collect {
    println("trips booked: ${it.data?.tripsBooked}")
  }
```

Because subscriptions are long-lasting operations, they return a `Flow<Response>` instead of a single `Response`.

## Terminating a subscription

Termination is handled through the coroutine scope. Cancel the coroutine to terminate the subscription.

By default, a single WebSocket is shared between all active subscriptions. When no subscription is active, the WebSocket is closed after a configurable timeout.

## Error handling

Like queries, subscriptions support partial responses with GraphQL errors, which are emitted in the `Flow`.

Network errors terminate the `Flow`, and you will have to retry it to get new updates. Retrying might reopen a new WebSocket or restart the subscription depending on the case.
