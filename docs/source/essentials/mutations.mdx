import {MultiCodeBlock} from 'gatsby-theme-apollo-docs';

Queries are useful to fetch data from a server, but client-server communication may also require sending data to the server. This is where Mutations become handy.
Just like REST, any request might end up causing some side-effects on the server, but by convention it's suggested that one doesn't use GET requests to modify data. GraphQL is similar - technically any query could be implemented to cause a data write.
However, it's useful to establish a convention that any operations that cause writes should be sent explicitly via a *mutation*.

Apollo Android handles GraphQL mutations. Mutations are similar to queries in syntax, the only difference being that you use the keyword `mutation` instead of `query` to indicate that the root fields on this query are going to be performing writes to the backend.

```
mutation UpvotePost($postId: Int!) {
  upvotePost(postId: $postId) {
    votes
  }
}
```

GraphQL mutations represent two things in one query string:

1. The mutation field name with arguments, `upvotePost`, which represents the actual operation to be done on the server
2. The fields you want back from the result of the mutation to update the client: `{ votes }`

The above mutation will upvote a post on the server. The result might be:

```
{
  "data": {
    "upvotePost": {
      "id": "123",
      "votes": 5
    }
  }
}
```

Similar to queries, mutations are represented by instances of generated classes, conforming to the `ApolloMutationCall` interface. Constructor arguments are used to define mutation variables. You pass a mutation object to `ApolloClient#perform(mutation)` to send the mutation to the server, execute it, and receive typed results:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
val upvotePostMutation = UpvotePostMutation(votes = 3)

apolloClient
    .mutate(upvotePostMutation)
    .enqueue(object: ApolloCall.Callback<UpvotePost.Data>() {
            override fun onResponse(response: Response<UpvotePost.Data>) {
                Log.i(TAG, response.toString());
            }
            
            override fun onFailure(e: ApolloException) {
                Log.e(TAG, e.getMessage(), e);
            }
        }
    )
```

```java
UpvotePostMutation upvotePostMutation = UpvotePostMutation.builder()
    .votes(3)
    .build();

apolloClient
    .mutate(upvotePostMutation)
    .enqueue(
        new ApolloCallback<>(new ApolloCall.Callback<UpvotePost.Data>() {
          @Override public void onResponse(@NotNull Response<UpvotePost.Data> response) {
              Log.i(TAG, response.toString());
          }
        
          @Override public void onFailure(@NotNull ApolloException e) {
              Log.e(TAG, e.getMessage(), e);
          }
        });
    );
```

## Using fragments in mutation results

In many cases, you'll want to use mutation results to update your UI. Fragments can be a great way of sharing result handling between queries and mutations:

```graphql
mutation UpvotePost($postId: Int!) {
  upvotePost(postId: $postId) {
    ...PostDetails
  }
}
```

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
apolloClient
    .mutate(upvotePostMutation)
    .enqueue(object: ApolloCall.Callback<UpvotePost.Data>() {
            override fun onFailure(e: ApolloException) {
                Log.i(TAG, response.data.upvotePost.fragments.postDetails);
            }

            override fun onResponse(response: Response<UpvotePost.Data>) {
                Log.e(TAG, e.getMessage(), e);
            }
        }
    )
```

```java
apolloClient
    .mutate(upvotePostMutation)
    .enqueue(
        new ApolloCallback<>(new ApolloCall.Callback<UpvotePost.Data>() {
          @Override public void onResponse(@NotNull Response<UpvotePost.Data> response) {
            Log.i(TAG, response.data.upvotePost.fragments.postDetails);
          }
        
          @Override public void onFailure(@NotNull ApolloException e) {
            Log.e(TAG, e.getMessage(), e);
          }
        })
    );
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Passing input objects

The GraphQL type system includes [input objects](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/#input-types) as a way to pass complex values to fields. Input objects are often defined as mutation variables, because they give you a compact way to pass in objects to be created:

```graphql
mutation CreateReviewForEpisode($episode: Episode!, $review: ReviewInput!) {
  createReview(episode: $episode, review: $review) {
    stars
    commentary
  }
}
```

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
val reviewInput = ReviewInput(stars = 5, commentary = "This is a great movie!")

apolloClient.mutate(CreateReviewForEpisodeMutation(episode = Episode.NEWHOPE, review = reviewInput))
```

```java
ReviewInput reviewInput = ReviewInput.Builder()
    .stars(5)
    .commentary("This is a great movie!")
    .build()

apolloClient.mutate(CreateReviewForEpisodeMutation(Episode.NEWHOPE, reviewInput))
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Designing mutation results

In GraphQL, mutations can return any type, and that type can be queried just like a regular GraphQL query. So the question is - what type should a particular mutation return?

In most cases, the data available from a mutation result should be the server developer's best guess of the data a client would need to understand what happened on the server. For example, a mutation that creates a new comment on a blog post might return the comment itself. A mutation that reorders an array might need to return the whole array.

## Uploading files

Apollo Android supports file uploading over [graphql-multipart-request-spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

You need to define this mapping in your build.gradle file.

```groovy
apollo {
  customScalarsMapping = [
    "Upload" : "com.apollographql.apollo.api.FileUpload"
  ]
}
```

**Note1** You don't need to register custom type adapter for `FileUpload`.

**Note2** While Apollo Android doesn't use reflection for regular operations, file upload is. If you're using Proguard/R8, you need to keep everything inheriting from `InputType`:

```proguard:title=proguard-rules.pro
-keep class * implements com.apollographql.apollo.api.InputType { *; }
```

In this example, the GraphQL schema uses custom scalar type named `Upload` for file upload. 
Change it to match your GraphQL schema.

Create graphql mutation.

```
mutation SingleUpload($file: Upload!) {
  singleUpload(file: $file) {
    id
    path
    filename
    mimetype
  }
}
```

Call your mutation with mimetype and a valid `File`.

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
  mutationSingle = SingleUploadMutation(file = FileUpload("image/jpeg", File("/my/image.jpg")))
```

```java
  mutationSingle = SingleUploadMutation.builder()
        .file(new FileUpload("image/jpeg", new File("/my/image.jpg")))
        .build();
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

If you don't have a `File`, you can also subclass `FileUpload`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
  object upload : FileUpload(mimetype) {
    override fun contentLength(): Long {
      TODO("return contentLength here")
    }
    override fun fileName(): String? {
      TODO("return fileName to use in the multipart request here")
    }
    override fun writeTo(sink: BufferedSink) {
      TODO("write the data here")
    }
  }
```

```java
  FileUpload upload = new FileUpload(mimetype) {
    @Override Long contentLength() {
      // return contentLength here
    }

    @Override String fileName() {
      // return fileName here
    }

    @Override void writeTo(sink: BufferedSink)() {
      // write the data here
    }
  };
```
