title: Get started with Multiplatform (Experimental)
---

import AddPlugin from "../shared/add-plugin.mdx"
import DownloadSchema from "../shared/download-schema.mdx"

**Note:** Multiplatform support is experimental and still under heavy development, expect the API to change. If you have feedback, we'd love to hear it. Please see [Contributing.md](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/blob/main/Contributing.md) for how to get in touch.

You can also check out the [multiplatform samples](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/tree/main/samples) for more details.

Kotlin multiplatform allows to use the same queries and generated models on both Android and iOS. On Android it uses [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) to handle the HTTP calls. On iOS, it uses [NSUrlConnection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlconnection).

## Add the Gradle plugin

<AddPlugin />

## Add the runtime dependencies

Multiplatform uses a different artifact from `apollo-runtime`. Its goal is to offer a coroutine-first API and is named `apollo-runtime-kotlin`:

```kotlin:title=build.gradle.kts
kotlin {
  // targets
  jvm()
  iosArm64("ios")

  sourceSets {
    commonMain {
      dependencies {
        //
        implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-runtime-kotlin:x.y.z")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Download your `schema.json` file

<DownloadSchema />

## Add your query

Add your `schema.json` and other `.graphql` files under `src/commonMain/graphql`. Build your module and generated code will be available
under `commonMain` sourceSet. That means you can use them both in `commonMain` or platform specific Kotlin code. Once the Kotlin plugin builds
the iOS Framework, generated code can even be called from Swift code.

## Executing your query

You use an instance of the `ApolloClient` class to interact with your server and cache.

To make a query using your generated models:

```kotlin
// First, create an `ApolloClient`
// Replace the serverUrl with your GraphQL endpoint
  val apolloClient = ApolloClient(
      networkTransport = ApolloHttpNetworkTransport(
          serverUrl = "https://your.domain/graphql/endpoint",
          headers = mapOf(
              "Accept" to "application/json",
              "Content-Type" to "application/json",
          )
      )
  )

// in your coroutine scope, call `ApolloClient.query(...).execute()`
scope.launch {
  // execute() returns a Flow, here we only take the first item
  val response = apolloClient.query(LaunchDetailsQuery(id = "83")).execute().single()

  // launch now contains a typesafe model of your data
  println("Launch site: ${response.data?.launch?.site"})
}
```
