Apollo Android supports [GraphQL fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments), which enable you to reuse a set of fields across multiple operations:

```graphql:title=Launch.graphql
fragment launchFragment on Launch {
  id
  site
  mission {
    name
  }
}

query LaunchDetails($id:ID!) {
  launch(id: $id) {
    ...launchFragment
  }
}
```

> These fragments are not to be confused with [inline fragments](./inline-fragments/), which are used to access fields of polymorphic types.

With the definitions above, Apollo Android generates a `LaunchFragment` class that can be reused in different queries:

```kotlin:title=LaunchFragment.kt
data class LaunchFragment(
  val id: String,
  val site: String?,
  val mission: Mission?
)
```

Generated models for operations that use the fragment have a `.launchFragment` property to access the fragment's fields:

```kotlin
println("Mission site: ${launch.launchFragment?.site}")
```

Note that `launchFragment` will be `null` or not depending on whether the returned object is a `Launch`.

You can reuse a fragment in any number of operations:

```graphql:title=Launch.graphql
 # ...previous definitions...

query LaunchList {
  launches {
    launches {
      ...launchFragment
    }
  }
}
```

You can even use a fragment in operations that are defined in a different `.graphql` file from the fragment itself. This is because Apollo Android codegen merges all `.graphql` files in to a _single_ file before generating models.
