title: Normalized cache
---

Apollo Android provides two different kinds of caches: an HTTP cache and a normalized cache. The HTTP cache is easier to set up but also has more limitations. This page focuses on the normalized cache. If you're looking for a simpler albeit coarser cache, take a look at the [HTTP cache](http-cache).

## Data Normalization:

The normalized cache stores objects by ID.

```graphl
query BookWithAuthorName {
  favoriteBook {
    id
    title
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

query AuthorById($id: String!) {
  author(id: $id) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, requesting the author of your favorite book with the `AuthorById` query will return a result from the cache if you requested your favorite book before. This works because the author is stored only once in the cache and all the fields where retrieved in the initial BookWithAuthorName query. If you were to request more fields, like `birthdate` for an example, that wouldn't work anymore.

## Storing your data in memory

Apollo Android comes with an `LruNormalizedCache` that will store your data in memory:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin title="Kotlin"
// Create a 10MB NormalizedCacheFactory
val cacheFactory = LruNormalizedCacheFactory(EvictionPolicy.builder().maxSizeBytes(10 * 1024 * 1024).build())

// Build the ApolloClient
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(cacheFactory)
  .build())
```

```java title="Java"
// Create a 10MB NormalizedCacheFactory
NormalizedCacheFactory cacheFactory = new LruNormalizedCacheFactory(EvictionPolicy.builder().maxSizeBytes(10 * 1024 * 1024).build());

// Build the ApolloClient
ApolloClient apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(cacheFactory)
  .build();
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Persisting your data in a SQLite database

If the amount of data you store becomes too big to fit in memory or if you want your data to persist between app restarts, you can also use a `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory`. A `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory` will store your data in a [SQLDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) database and is defined in a separate dependency:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo:apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite:x.y.z")
}
```

**Note:** The `apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite` dependency has Kotlin multiplatform support and has multiple variants (`-jvm`, `-android`, `-ios-arm64`,...). If you are targetting Android and using custom `buildTypes`, you will need to help Gradle resolve the correct artifact by defining [matchingFallbacks](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies?authuser=2#resolve_matching_errors):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin title="build.gradle"
android {
  buildTypes {
    create("custom") {
      // your code...
      matchingFallbacks = listOf("debug")
    }
  }
}
```

```groovy title="build.gradle"
android {
  buildTypes {
    custom {
      // your code...
      matchingFallbacks = ["debug"]
    }
  }
}
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Once the dependency is added, create the `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
// Android
val sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory(context, "apollo.db")
// JVM
val sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory("jdbc:sqlite:apollo.db")
// iOS
val sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory("apollo.db")

// Build the ApolloClient
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(sqlNormalizedCacheFactory)
  .build())
```

```java
// Android
SqlNormalizedCacheFactory sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = new SqlNormalizedCacheFactory(context, "apollo.db")
// JVM
SqlNormalizedCacheFactory sqlNormalizedCacheFactory = new SqlNormalizedCacheFactory("jdbc:sqlite:apollo.db")

// Build the ApolloClient
ApolloClient apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(sqlNormalizedCacheFactory)
  .build();
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Chaining caches

To get the best of both caches, you can chain an `LruNormalizedCacheFactory` with a `SqlNormalizedCacheFactory`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin title="Kotlin"

val sqlCacheFactory = SqlNormalizedCacheFactory(context, "db_name")
val memoryFirstThenSqlCacheFactory = LruNormalizedCacheFactory(
    EvictionPolicy.builder().maxSizeBytes(10 * 1024 * 1024).build()
).chain(sqlCacheFactory)

```

```java title="Java"

NormalizedCacheFactory sqlCacheFactory = new SqlNormalizedCacheFactory(context, "db_name");
NormalizedCacheFactory memoryFirstThenSqlCacheFactory = new LruNormalizedCacheFactory(
  EvictionPolicy.builder().maxSizeBytes(10 * 1024 * 1024).build()
).chain(sqlCacheFactory);

```
</MultiCodeBlock>

Reads will read from the first cache hit in the chain. Writes will propagate down the entire chain.

## Specifying your object IDs

By default, Apollo Android uses the field path as key to store data. Back to the original example:

```graphl
query BookWithAuthorName {
  favoriteBook {
    id
    title
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

query AuthorById($id: String!) {
  author(id: $id) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

This will store the following records:

* `"favoriteBook"`: `{"id": "book1", "title": "Les guerriers du silence", "author": "ApolloCacheReference{favoriteBook.author}"}`
* `"favoriteBook.author"`: `{"id": "author1", name": "Pierre Bordage"}`
* `"author("id": "author1")"`: `{"id": "author1", "name": "Pierre Bordage"}`
* `"QUERY_ROOT"`: `{"favoriteBook": "ApolloCacheReference{favoriteBook}", "author(\"id\": \"author1\")": "ApolloCacheReference{author(\"id\": \"author1\")}"}`

This is undesirable, both because it takes more space, and because modifying one of those objects will not notify the watchers of the other. What you want instead is this:

* `"book1"`: `{"id": "book1", "title": "Les guerriers du silence", "author": "ApolloCacheReference{author1}"}`
* `"author1"`: `{"id": "author1", name": "Pierre Bordage"}`
* `"QUERY_ROOT"`: `{"favoriteBook": "book1", "author(\"id\": \"author1\")": "author1"}`

To do this, specify a `CacheKeyResolver` when configuring your `NormalizedCacheFactory`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin title="Kotlin"
val resolver: CacheKeyResolver = object : CacheKeyResolver() {
  override fun fromFieldRecordSet(field: ResponseField, recordSet: Map<String, Any>): CacheKey {
    // Retrieve the id from the object itself
    return CacheKey.from(recordSet["id"] as String)
  }

  override fun fromFieldArguments(field: ResponseField, variables: Operation.Variables): CacheKey {
    // Retrieve the id from the field arguments.
    // In the example, this allows to know that `author(id: "author1")` will retrieve `author1`
    // That sounds straightforward but without this, the cache would have no way of finding the id before executing the request on the
    // network which is what we want to avoid
    return CacheKey.from(field.resolveArgument("id", variables) as String)
  }
}

val apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://...")
    .normalizedCache(cacheFactory, resolver)
    .build()
```

```java title="Java"
CacheKeyResolver resolver = new CacheKeyResolver() {
   @NotNull @Override
   public CacheKey fromFieldRecordSet(@NotNull ResponseField field, @NotNull Map<String, Object> recordSet) {
     // Retrieve the id from the object itself
     return CacheKey.from((String) recordSet.get("id"));
   }

   @NotNull @Override
   public CacheKey fromFieldArguments(@NotNull ResponseField field, @NotNull Operation.Variables variables) {
     // Retrieve the id from the field arguments.
     // In the example, this allows to know that `author(id: "author1")` will retrive `author1`
     // That sounds straightforward but without this, the cache would have no way of finding the id before executing the request on the
     // network which is what we want to avoid
     return CacheKey.from((String) field.resolveArgument("id", variables));
   }
};

//Build the ApolloClient
ApolloClient apolloClient = ApolloClient.builder()
  .serverUrl("https://...")
  .normalizedCache(cacheFactory, resolver)
  .build();
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

For this resolver to work, every object in your graph needs to have a globally unique ID. If some of them don't have one, you can fall back to using the path as cache key by returning `CacheKey.NO_KEY`.

## Using the cache with your queries

You control how the cache is used with [`ResponseFetchers`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/blob/main/apollo-runtime/src/main/java/com/apollographql/apollo/fetcher/ApolloResponseFetchers.java):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
// Get a response from the cache if possible. Else, get a response from the network
// This is the default behavior
val apolloCall = apolloClient().query(BookWithAuthorName()).responseFetcher(ApolloResponseFetchers.CACHE_FIRST)
```

```java
// Get a response from the cache if possible. Else, get a response from the network
// This is the default behavior
ApolloCall apolloCall = apolloClient().query(new BookWithAuthorName()).responseFetcher(ApolloResponseFetchers.CACHE_FIRST)
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Other possibilities are `CACHE_ONLY`, `NETWORK_ONLY`, `CACHE_AND_NETWORK_ONLY` and `NETWORK_FIRST`. See to the [`ResponseFetchers` class](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/blob/main/apollo-runtime/src/main/java/com/apollographql/apollo/fetcher/ApolloResponseFetchers.java) for more details.

## Reacting to changes in the cache

One big advantage of using a normalized cache is that your UI can now react to changes in your cache data. If you want to be notified every time something changes in `book1`, you can use a `QueryWatcher`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
  apolloClient.query(BookWithAuthorName()).watcher().toFlow().collect { response ->
      // This will be called every time the book or author changes
  }
```

```java
  apolloClient.query(new BookWithAuthorName()).watcher().enqueueAndWatch(new ApolloCall.Callback<T>() {
     @Override public void onResponse(@NotNull Response<T> response) {
       // This will be called every time the book or author changes
     }

     @Override public void onFailure(@NotNull ApolloException e) {
       // This will be called if an error happens
     }
  });
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Interacting with the cache

To manipulate the cache directly, `ApolloStore` exposes `read()` and `write()` methods:

```kotlin
  // Reading data from the store
  val data = apolloClient.apolloStore.read(BookWithAuthorName()).execute()

  // Create data to write
  val data = BookWithAuthorName.Data(
    id = "book1",
    title = "Les guerriers du silence",
    author = BookWithAuthorName.Author(
      id = "author1",
      name = "Pierre Bordage"
    )
  )
  // Write to the store. All watchers will be notified
  apolloClient.apolloStore.writeAndPublish(BookWithAuthorName(), data).execute()
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing cache misses, check your cache size and eviction policy. Some records might have been removed from the cache. Increasing the cache size and/or retention period will help hitting your cache more consistently. 

If you are still experiencing cache misses, you can dump the contents of the cache:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```kotlin
val dump = apolloClient.getApolloStore().normalizedCache().dump();
NormalizedCache.prettifyDump(dump)
```

```java
Map<KClass<?>, Map<String, Record>> dump = apolloClient.getApolloStore().normalizedCache().dump();
NormalizedCache.prettifyDump(dump)
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

Make sure that no data is duplicated in the dump. If it is the case, it probably means that some objects have a wrong `CacheKey`. Make sure to provide a `CacheKeyResolver` that can work with your graph. All objects should have a unique and stable ID. That means that the ID should be the same no matter what path the object is in the graph. That also mean you have to include the identifier field in your queries to be able to use in from the `CacheKeyResolver`.

Finally, make sure to design your queries so that you can reuse fields. A single missing field in the cache for a query will trigger a network fetch. Sometimes it might be useful to query an extra field early on so that it can be reused by other later queries.
