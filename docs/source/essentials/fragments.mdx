title: Fragments
---

Apollo Android supports [GraphQL fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments). Fragments allow you to define a set of fields that can be reusable in your queries.

```graphql title="Launch.graphql"
fragment launchFragment on Launch {
  id
  site
  mission {
    name
  }
}

query LaunchDetails($id:ID!) {
  launch(id: $id) {
    ...launchFragment
  }
}
```

Apollo Android will generate a `LaunchFragment` class that can be reused in different queries:

```kotlin title="LaunchFragment.kt"
data class LaunchFragment(
     val __typename: String = "Launch",
     val id: String,
     val site: String?,
     val mission: Mission?
   )
```

Your generated models will have a `.fragments` property to access the fragments:

```kotlin
println("Mission site: ${launch.fragments.launchFragment.site}")
```

To reuse a fragment, use it in any other query:

```graphql title="Launch.graphql"
// ...

query LaunchList {
  launches {
	launches {
      ...launchFragment
    }
  }
}
```
You can define your fragment in any `.graphql` file. The compiler merges all `.graphql` files so it doesn't matter if you have multiple files or put everything in the same file.
