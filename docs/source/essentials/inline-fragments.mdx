Apollo Android supports [GraphQL inline fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments), which are used to access fields of [polymorphic types](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/unions-interfaces/):

```graphql{4-9}:title=HeroQuery.graphql
query HeroForEpisode($ep: Episode!) {
  hero(episode: $ep) {
    name
    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }
    ... on Human {
      height
    }
  }
}
```

> Inline fragments are not to be confused with [named fragments](./named-fragments/), which are used to reuse fields across multiple operations.

When an operation includes the fragments above, the generated `Hero` class will contain `OnDroid` and `OnHuman` nested classes and `onDroid` / `onHuman` fields, which enable you to access fields that are specific to `Droid` and `Human`:

```kotlin
println("Droid primaryFunction: ${hero.onDroid?.primaryFunction}")
println("Human height: ${hero.onHuman?.height}")
```

Note that the `onXyz` fields will be `null` or not depending on the actual type of Hero returned by the server.
