title: Inline Fragments
---

Apollo Android supports [GraphQL inline fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments), which are used to access fields of [polymorphic types](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/unions-interfaces/):

```graphql{4-9}:title=HeroQuery.graphql
query HeroForEpisode($ep: Episode!) {
  hero(episode: $ep) {
    name
    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }
    ... on Human {
      height
    }
  }
}
```

> Inline fragments are not to be confused with [named fragments](./50-named-fragments/), which are used to reuse fields across multiple operations.

If codegen includes the operation above, the generated `Hero` class contains `AsDroid` and `AsHuman` nested classes, which enable you to access fields that are specific to `Droid` and `Human`:

```kotlin
println("Droid primaryFunction: ${hero.asDroid?.primaryFunction}")
println("Human height: ${hero.asHuman?.height}")
```
