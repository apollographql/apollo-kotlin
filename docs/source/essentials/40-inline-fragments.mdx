title: Inline Fragments
---

Apollo Android supports [GraphQL inline fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments). They are not to be confused with named fragments that are used to reused fields. Inline fragments are used to access polymorphic types:

```graphql:title=Hero.graphql
query HeroForEpisode($ep: Episode!) {
  hero(episode: $ep) {
    name
    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }
    ... on Human {
      height
    }
  }
}
```

The Hero class will contain `AsDroid` and `AsHuman` nested classes to access the Droid fields and human fields respectively:

```kotlin
println("Droid primaryFunction: ${hero.asDroid?.primaryFunction}")
println("Human height: ${hero.asHuman?.height}")
```
