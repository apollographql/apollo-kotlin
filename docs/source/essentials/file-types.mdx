title: File types
---

Apollo Android supports the following file types:

* `.json` for introspection schemas
* `.graphqls` for SDL schemas
* `.graphql` for operations (queries, mutations and subscriptions)

Schemas describe the data types and relationships between them. Operations describe how to request or modify the data.

## Introspection schemas (.json)

Introspection schemas are downloadable through [introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/). If you have a GraphQL endpoint and introspection wasn't disabled, it's an easy way to get the schema. Tools like [Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/) will allow you to download the schema in json format.

You can also download it with Apollo Android with the `downloadApolloSchema` Gradle task:

```
./gradlew :app:downloadApolloSchema --endpoint "https://example.com/graphql"
 --schema schema.json
```

Introspection schemas are the result of an introspection query and should look like below:

```json:title=schema.json
{
  "data": {
    "__schema": {
      "queryType": {
        "name": "Query"
      },
      "mutationType": {
        "name": "Mutation"
      },
      "types": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

You might come accross some `schema.json` files that skip the `"data"` field, that's OK too, Apollo Android supports that.

If you unfold the `"types"` field, you will find a big list of types. They describe all types in the schema with all their fields. It's a very verbose format, not easy to read or modify. For a more compact format, you can use SDL schemas.


## SDL Schemas (.graphqls)

SDL (Schema Definition Language) is a more expressive syntax for describing schemas. In fact SDL, in merely a subset of the [GraphQL language](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Appendix-Grammar-Summary). The GraphQL language contains [Type System Sefinitions](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#TypeSystemDefinitionOrExtension) and [Executable Definitions](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#ExecutableDefinition).

> Note: Apollo Android also supports `.sdl` file extensions for SDL schemas but very few other tools use `.sdl` and `.graphqls` is the preferred file extension moving forward.

A file that only contains Type System Definitions is a schema. You can get one from some tools like [Studio](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/) or from your backend team directly.

Unlike introspection, there's no way to download a SDL schema from your endpoint directly but Apollo Android will convert your introspection schema to a SDL schema automatically if you specify the `.graphqls` extension:

```
./gradlew :app:downloadApolloSchema --endpoint "https://example.com/graphql"
--schema schema.graphqls
```

The file will look like:

```graphql:title=schema.graphqls
type schema {
  query: Query
  mutation: Mutation
}

type Query {
  field: String
  ...
}
```

This format is more compact and easier to read and modify. Another advantage is that the SDL format carries GraphQL directives, which the Json format doesn't (see [this issue](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/300))

## Operations (.graphql)

Operation files use the `.graphql` (without `'s'`) extension and only contain [Executable Definitions](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#ExecutableDefinition) (queries, mutations, subscriptions or fragments).

These are the files where you define your queries and mutations. They usually look like:

```
query MyQuery {
  field1
  field2
  ...
}
```

Apollo Android will compile these queries into type-safe models that you can use at runtime.
