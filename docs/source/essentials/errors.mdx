title: Error handling
---

Whenever you execute a GraphQL operation with Apollo Kotlin (or any other GraphQL client), two high-level types of errors can occur:

* **Network errors**: a GraphQL response wasn't received because an error occurred while communicating with your GraphQL server. This might be an SSL error, a socket error because your app is offline, or a 500 or any other HTTP error. When a network error occurs, no data is returned.
* **GraphQL errors**: a GraphQL response _is_ received, and it contains a non-empty [`errors`](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Errors) field. This means the server wasn't able to completely process the query. The response might include _partial_ data if the server was able to process _some_ of the query.


## Network errors

Network errors throw an `ApolloException`. To handle them, wrap your query in a `try/catch` block:

```kotlin
try {
  val response = apolloClient.query(query).execute()
} catch(exception: ApolloException) {
  // handle exception here
}
```

**Non-exhaustive list of possible causes:**

* The app is offline or doesn't have access to the network.
* A DNS error occurred, making it impossible to look up the host.
* An SSL error occurred (e.g., the server certificate isn't trusted).
* The connection was closed.
* The server responded with a non-successful HTTP code.
* The server didn't respond with valid JSON.
* The response JSON doesn't satisfy the schema and cannot be parsed.
* A request was specified as CacheOnly but the data wasn't cached.
* ...

Examine the exception to get more detailed information about the actual error happening.

## GraphQL errors

Because GraphQL errors might still contain data, they do _not_ throw. Instead, they return a `Response` with a `Response.errors` field indicating the errors that occurred.

For example, the following query uses an invalid `id` to look up a `Person`:

```graphql
query FilmAndPersonQuery {
  film(id: "ZmlsbXM6MQ==") {
    title
  }
  person(id: "badId") {
    name
  }
}
```

The server will send the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "film": {
      "title": "A New Hope"
    },
    "person": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "No entry in local cache for https://swapi.dev/api/people/m�H/",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 35,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "path": [
        "person"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that while there are errors, the query successfully returned the title of the film: `A New Hope`. In general, any error while executing an operation [bubbles up](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Errors) to the next nullable field. In this case, `person` is nullable. In the worst case, `response.data` can be null if everything else is non-nullable.

Apollo Kotlin gives you access to both the data and the errors in the `Response` class:

```kotlin
val response = try {
  apolloClient.query(query).execute()
} catch(exception: ApolloException) {
  // Network error, not much to do
  throw exception
}

// It's possible to display the film title
val title = response.data?.film?.title
if (title != null) {
  println(title)
}

// The person triggered an error
val person = response.data?.person?.name
if (person != null) {
  // do something with response.errors
}
```

## Ignoring partial data

If you don't want to handle partial responses, you can simplify your error handling logic. `ApolloResponse.dataAssertNoErrors` will return a non-nullable `data` and throw if there are any errors. This way, you can handle all errors in a single `catch {}` block:

```
val data = try {
  apolloClient.query(query).execute().dataAssertNoErrors
} catch(exception: ApolloException) {
  // All network or GraphQL errors are handled here
  throw exception
}

// No need for safe calls on data
val title = data.film?.title
```

Note that the safe call is still required on `film` because this field has a nullable type in the GraphQL schema. There are ways to override this in codegen. For more details, see [@nonnull](../advanced/nonnull).
