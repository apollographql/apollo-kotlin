title: Error handling

You can use `response.data` to check if the server returned valid data:

```kotlin
val response = apolloClient.query(ExampleQuery()).execute()
// Using 'data' to be able to do a smart cast below (KT-8819)
val data = response.data

when {
  data != null -> {
    // data can be smart cast to non-null here
    println("The server returned data: $data")
  }
  else -> {
    // an error happened, check response.exception for more details or just display a generic error 
    when (response.exception) {
      is ApolloGraphQLException -> // do something with exception.errors
      is ApolloHttpException -> // do something with exception.statusCode
      is ApolloNetworkException -> TODO()
      is ApolloParseException -> TODO()
      else -> // generic error
    }
  }
}
```

This is also true when calling `toFlow()` (e.g. with [subscriptions](../essentials/subscription)) and `watch()` (with the [normalized cache](../caching/query-watchers)).

```kotlin
apolloClient.subscription(subscription).toFlow().collect { response ->
  if (response.data != null) {
    // handle data
  } else {
    // handle exceptions
  }
}
```

If you prefer throwing, you can use `dataOrThrow()` to get a non-null data:

```kotlin
val data = apolloClient.query(ExampleQuery()).execute().dataOrThrow()
// data is non-null
```

## Different types of errors

Whenever you execute a GraphQL operation with Apollo Kotlin (or any other GraphQL client), two high-level types of errors can occur:

* **Network errors**: a GraphQL response wasn't received because an error occurred while communicating with your GraphQL server. This might be an SSL error, a socket error because your app is offline, or a 500 or any other HTTP error. When a network error occurs, no data is returned.
* **GraphQL errors**: a GraphQL response _is_ received, and it contains a non-empty [`errors`](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Errors) field. This means the server wasn't able to completely process the query. The response might include _partial_ data if the server was able to process _some_ of the query.

### GraphQL errors

For example, the following query uses an invalid `id` to look up a `Person`:

```graphql
query FilmAndPersonQuery {
  film(id: "ZmlsbXM6MQ==") {
    title
  }
  person(id: "badId") {
    name
  }
}
```

The server will send the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "film": {
      "title": "A New Hope"
    },
    "person": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "No entry in local cache for https://swapi.dev/api/people/mï¿½H/",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 35,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "path": [
        "person"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that while there are errors, the query successfully returned the title of the film: `A New Hope`. In general, any error while executing an operation [bubbles up](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Errors) to the next nullable field. In this case, `person` is nullable. In the worst case, `response.data` can be null if everything else is non-nullable.

When GraphQL errors happen, `ApolloResponse.exception` will be an instance of `ApolloGraphQLException` and you can use `exception.errors` to read the actual GraphQL errors.

### Network errors

Network errors are more varied and can have different causes (non-exhaustive list):

* The app is offline or doesn't have access to the network.
* A DNS error occurred, making it impossible to look up the host.
* An SSL error occurred (e.g., the server certificate isn't trusted).
* The connection was closed.
* The server responded with a non-successful HTTP code.
* The server didn't respond with valid JSON.
* The response JSON doesn't satisfy the schema and cannot be parsed.
* A request was specified as CacheOnly but the data wasn't cached.
* More...


## Ignoring partial data

Because errors may happen on any field in your query, your UI code needs to handle any nullable field. In the example above, data.person will be `null`: 

```graphql
query FilmAndPersonQuery {
  # wrong id here, null will be returned
  person(id: "badId") {
    name
  }
}
```

Your UI code needs to check for null:

```kotlin
if (data.person != null) {
  // display person
}
```

If you prefer to catch these errors at parsing time, you can make `data.person` non-nullable using [the `@nonnull` directive](../advanced/nonnull):

```graphql
extend type Query @nonnull(fields: "person")
```

Alternatively, you can check for errors in an interceptor and force data to null whenever a GraphQL error happens: 

```kotlin
object ignorePartialDataInterceptor: ApolloInterceptor {
  override fun <D : Operation.Data> intercept(request: ApolloRequest<D>, chain: ApolloInterceptorChain): Flow<ApolloResponse<D>> {
    return chain.proceed(request).map {
      if (it.exception is ApolloGraphQLException) {
        // nullify data altogether
        it.newBuilder().data(null).build()
      } else {
        it
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the null check is still required on `person` because this field has a nullable type in the GraphQL schema.
