# Module apollo-mockserver

`apollo-mockserver` is a HTTP server for your tests. It supports multiplatform and websockets. 

The API is minimal and performance is a non-goal. Do not use for production APIs. 

This module is deprecated and moved to the Apollo Galaxy. See the [Apollo Galaxy page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/galaxy) for more details.
