# Module apollo-runtime-java

`apollo-runtime-java` is an implementation of `ApolloClient` that doesn't use coroutines and more generally is more friendly for Java callers.

This module is deprecated and moved to the Apollo Galaxy. See the [Apollo Galaxy page](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/galaxy) for more details.
