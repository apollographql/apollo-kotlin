# Module apollo-normalized-cache-api

`apollo-normalized-cache-api` is the low-level cache. It knows nothing about coroutines and/or `apollo-runtime` and contains a memory implementation of `NormalizedCache`.

Most of the time, use `apollo-normalized-cache` instead.

See ["Normalized Caches"](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/caching/normalized-cache#in-memory-cache) for how to use the normalized cache.
