 * The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key
 * for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be
 * human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as `"4"`) or integer (such as `4`)
 * input value will be accepted as an ID.
