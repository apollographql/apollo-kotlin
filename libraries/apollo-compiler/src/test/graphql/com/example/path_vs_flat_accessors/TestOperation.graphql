# This test generating accessors based on the inline fragment path input by the user versus
# a more global approach. Matching the user input is more predictable but also more verbose
# User input: root.asA.asB (root.asB.asA doesn't make sense and is not possible)
# Global: root.asAB (how to end up with AB doesn't matter)
