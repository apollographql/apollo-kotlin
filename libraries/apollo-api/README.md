# Module apollo-api

`apollo-api` contains the bare minimum symbols to compile the generated code and parse responses.

It does not contain any networking or caching code. For a more complete artifact, see `apollo-runtime`. 

See ["Using the models without apollo-runtime"](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/no-runtime) for how to use `apollo-api`.
