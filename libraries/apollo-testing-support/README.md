# Module apollo-testing-support

This module contains:

* `QueueTestNetworkTransport` and `MapTestNetworkTransport` for testing without a mock server.
* a set of helper functions used for Apollo tests. They were never really intended to become public and will be removed in a future version. These symbols are marked as deprecated. If you are using them, copy paste them in your project.
