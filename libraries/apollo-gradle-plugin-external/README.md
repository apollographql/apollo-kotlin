# Module apollo-gradle-plugin-external

`apollo-gradle-plugin-external` contains the Apollo Gradle plugin.

This module does not shadow its runtime dependencies, making it more prone to Gradle classpath issues.

See `apollo-gradle-plugin` for a version of `apollo-gradle-plugin-external` that shadow its dependencies.

See ["Gradle Plugin Configuration"](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/advanced/plugin-configuration/) for how to use the Gradle plugin.
