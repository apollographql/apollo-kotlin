Apollo Android is a GraphQL client that generates Kotlin and Java models from GraphQL queries. These models give you a type-safe API to work with GraphQL servers. Apollo helps you keep your GraphQL queries together, organized, and easy to access.

This library is designed primarily with Android in mind, but you can use it in any Java/Kotlin app.

## Features

* Java and Kotlin Multiplatform code generation
* Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions
* Reflection-free parsing 
* Normalized cache
* Custom scalar types
* HTTP cache
* Auto Persisted Queries
* Query batching
* File uploads
* Espresso IdlingResource
* Fake models for tests
* AppSync and graphql-ws websockets
* GraphQL AST parser

## Documentation

Check [the project website](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/) for in depth documentation.

## Getting started

If you are new to GraphQL, check out [the tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3/tutorial/00-introduction/) that will guide you through building an Android app using Apollo, Kotlin and coroutines.

If you'd like to add Apollo Android to an existing project, follow these steps:

Add the plugin to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("com.apollographql.apollo3").version("x.y.z")
}
```

Add the runtime dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies { 
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime:x.y.z")
}
```

Set the package name to use for the generated models:

```kotlin
apollo {
  packageName.set("com.example")
}
```

Apollo Android supports three types of files:
- `.graphqls` schema files: describes the types in your backend using the GraphQL syntax.  
- `.json` schema files: describes the types in your backend using the Json syntax.
- `.graphql` executable files: describes your queries and operations in the GraphQL syntax.

By default, Apollo Android requires a schema in your module `src/main/graphql` directory. You can download a schema using introspection with the `./gradlew downloadApolloSchema` task. Sometimes introspection is disabled and you will have to ask your backend team to provide a schema. Copy this schema to your module:

```
cp ${schema} ${module}/src/main/graphql/ 
```

Write a query in a `${module}/src/main/graphql/GetRepository.graphql` file:

```graphql
query HeroQuery($id: String!) {
  hero(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    appearsIn
  }
}
```

Build your project, this will generate a `HeroQuery` class that you can use with an instance of `ApolloClient`:

```kotlin
  // Create a client
  val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
      .serverUrl("https://example.com/graphql")
      .build()

  // Execute your query. This will suspend until the response is received.
  val response = apolloClient.query(HeroQuery(id = "1")).execute()

  println("Hero.name=${response.data?.hero?.name}")
```

For more information, check [the project website](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/v3).

## IntelliJ Plugin

The [JS Graphql IntelliJ Plugin](https://jimkyndemeyer.github.io/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/) provides auto-completion, error highlighting, and go-to-definition functionality for your `.graphql` files. You can create a [`.graphqlconfig`](https://jimkyndemeyer.github.io/js-graphql-intellij-plugin/docs/developer-guide#working-with-graphql-endpoints-and-scratch-files) file to use GraphQL scratch files to work with your schema outside product code (such as to write temporary queries to test resolvers).

## Releases

The latest version is [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.apollographql.apollo3/apollo-api)](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/apollographql/apollo3/)

Check the [changelog](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/releases) for the release history.

Releases are hosted on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/apollographql/apollo3/). The plugin is additionally hosted on the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.apollographql.apollo3)


```kotlin
plugins {
  id("com.apollographql.apollo3").version("x.y.z")
}

repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-runtime:x.y.z")

  // optional: if you want to use the normalized cache
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite:x.y.z")
  // optional: if you just want the generated models and parsers and write your own HTTP code/cache code, you can remove apollo-runtime
  // and use apollo-api instead  
  implementation("com.apollographql.apollo3:apollo-api:x.y.z")
}
```

## Snapshots

Latest development changes are available in Sonatype's snapshots repository:

```kotlin:title=build.gradle.kts
repositories {
  maven { 
    url = uri("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/")
  }
}
```

## Multiplatform

Apollo Android is a [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) project. 

Here's the current matrix of supported features per platform:

|  | `jvm` | AppleÂ¹ | `js` | `linuxX64`
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `apollo-api` (models)|âœ…|âœ…|âœ…|âœ…|
| `apollo-runtime` (network, query batching, apq, ...) |âœ…|âœ…|âœ…Â²|ðŸš«|
| `apollo-normalized-cache` |âœ…|âœ…|âœ…|ðŸš«|
| `apollo-adapters` |âœ…|âœ…|âœ…|ðŸš«|
| `apollo-normalized-cache-sqlite` |âœ…|âœ…|ðŸš«|ðŸš«|
