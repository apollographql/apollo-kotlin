## üöÄ Apollo Kotlin

Apollo Kotlin is a strongly typed GraphQL client that generates Kotlin models for your GraphQL operations.

Apollo Kotlin executes operations against a GraphQL server and returns results as operation-specific Kotlin types. This means you don't have to deal with parsing JSON, or passing around `Map`s and making clients cast values to the right type manually. You also don't have to write model types yourself, because these are generated from the GraphQL definitions your app uses.

Because generated types are operation-specific, you can only access data that you actually specify as part of an operation. If you don't ask for a particular field in an operation, you can't access the corresponding property on the returned data structure.

This library is designed with Android in mind, but you can use it in any Kotlin application, including KMP ([Kotlin Multi Platform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html)).

## üë®‚Äçüíª Who is Apollo?

[Apollo](https://apollographql.com/) builds open-source tools and commercial services to make application development easier, better, and accessible to more people. We help you ship faster with:

* [GraphOS](https://www.apollographql.com/graphos) - The platform for building, managing, and scaling a supergraph: a unified network of your organization's microservices and their data sources‚Äîall composed into a single distributed API.
* [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/federation) ‚Äì The industry-standard open architecture for building a distributed graph. Use Apollo‚Äôs gateway to compose a unified graph from multiple subgraphs, determine a query plan, and route requests across your services.
* [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) ‚Äì The most popular GraphQL client for the web. Apollo also builds and maintains [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) and [Apollo Kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin).
* [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) ‚Äì A production-ready JavaScript GraphQL server that connects to any microservice, API, or database. Compatible with all popular JavaScript frameworks and deployable in serverless environments.
