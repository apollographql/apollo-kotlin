# apollo-normalized-cache

This module defines `ApolloStore` and `ApolloCacheInterceptor`. `apollo-store` would be a better name but there's just too much stuff out there that uses `apollo-normalized-cache`. Contrary to `apollo-normalized-cache-api`, this module does require `apollo-runtime` and coroutines.
