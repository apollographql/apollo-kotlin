Contributing to Apollo Android GraphQL 
=======================

The Apollo team welcomes contributions of all kinds, from simple bug reports through documentation, test cases,
bugfixes, and features.

DOs and DON'Ts
--------------

* DO follow our coding style (as described below)
* DO give priority to the current style of the project or file you're changing even if it diverges from the general guidelines.
* DO include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
* DO keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new issue than to side track the discussion.
* DO run all Gradle verification tasks (`./gradlew check`) before submitting a pull request

* DO NOT send PRs for style changes.
* DON'T surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
* DON'T commit code that you didn't write. If you find code that you think is a good fit, file an issue and start a discussion before proceeding.
* DON'T submit PRs that alter licensing related files or headers. If you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be happy to discuss it.


Coding Style
------------

The coding style employed here is fairly conventional Java - indentations are four spaces, class
names are PascalCased, identifiers and methods are camelCased.    

Workflow
--------

We love Github issues!  Before working on any new features, please open an issue so that we can agree on the
direction, and hopefully avoid investing a lot of time on a feature that might need reworking.

Small pull requests for things like typos, bugfixes, etc are always welcome.

Please note that we will not accept pull requests for style changes.
